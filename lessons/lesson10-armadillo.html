  <span class="brand__power">Grammar</span> - Když minulost ovlivňuje současnost
  a trvá nějakou dobu

<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  Že už to ta angličtina krapet překombinovává? Možná.
  <span class="example-underlined"
    >Předpřítomný čas průběhový (present perfect continuous)</span

  se však používá častěji, než si možná myslíte. Stejně jako předpřítomný čas
  prostý má také aktivní dopad na současnost a vyjadřuje dvě možnosti:
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph expanded">
  1. Činnost trvala delší dobu a sice jako taková skončila, ale má aktivní dopad
  na současnost.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 Oof, my right hand hurts! I've been coding for five hours.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 Our team has been developing a new mobile application for the past six
  months, aiming to improve user accessibility and functionality. = Update byl
  ve velmi nedávné době dokončen a možná se ještě něco fixuje.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 The developers have been debugging the code all morning, and they've
  finally resolved the last of the errors.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph expanded">
  2. Činnost začala v minulosti, trvala nějakou dobu a v současnosti ještě stále
  trvá.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 I've been working in IBM for six years. = A ještě pořád pracuju.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 The cybersecurity administrator has been monitoring the network traffic
  since early morning to identify any unauthorized access or potential security
  threats.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 The software engineers have been implementing machine learning algorithms
  for several months to enhance the capabilities of ChatGPT.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph expanded">🕔 Vyjádření průběhu</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  Protože present perfect continuous vyjadřuje trvání dané činnost, asi vás
  nepřekvapí, že se často pojí s časovými výrazy jako
  <span class="example-underlined">how long, for, since, recently, all day</span
  >.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 She's been debugging all day. = Den ještě neskončil.

  Since - od určitého časového úseku doteď

<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 They've been working on that huge system update since February. = Ještě
  pořád na tom pracují.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph expanded">
  For - po jak jaký časový úsek něco trvalo/trvá
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 He's been trying to fix that bug for six hours.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph expanded">Recently - nedávno (jednorázově)</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">🧩 I've recently bought a new laptop.</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph expanded">Lately - poslední dobou (opakovaně)</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 I've been feeling really confident about my programming skills lately
  because I've been watching tutorials every day. = Buď ještě pořád tutoriály
  sleduju nebo dávám důraz na délku trvání.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph expanded">How long...? - pro otázky</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 How long have you been working as a data analyst? = Víme, že ještě stále
  jako datový analytik pracuje.

    Our ability to learn and get better at tasks through experience is part of
    being human. When we are born, we know almost nothing and can do almost
    nothing for ourselves, but soon we're learning and becoming more capable
    every day. But did you know that computers can do the same? Machine learning
    brings together statistics and computer science to enable computers to learn
    how to do a given task without being programmed to do so. Just as your brain
    uses experience to improve a task, so can computers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Say you need a computer that can tell the difference between a picture of a
    dog and a picture of a cat. You could begin by feeding it images and telling
    it this one's a dog, that one's a cat. A computer programmed to learn will
    seek statistical patterns within the data that will enable it to recognize a
    cat or dog in the future. It might figure out on its own that cats have
    shorter noses and dogs come in a larger variety of sizes and then represent
    that information numerically organizing in space. But crucially, it's the
    computer, not the programmer, that identifies those patterns and establishes
    the algorithm by which future data will be sorted.
  </p>
  <p>
    One example of a simple yet highly effective algorithm is to find the
    optimal line separating cats from dogs. When the computer sees a new
    picture, it checks which side of the line it falls on and then says either
    cat or dog. But of course, there can be mistakes. The more data the computer
    receives, the more finely tuned its algorithm becomes, and the more accurate
    it can be in its predictions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Machine learning is already widely applied. It's the technology behind
    facial recognition, text to speech recognition, spam filters on your inbox,
    online shopping or viewing recommendations, credit card fraud detection, and
    so much more. At the University of Oxford, machine learning researchers are
    combining statistics and computer science to build algorithms that can solve
    more complex problems, more efficiently, using less computing power. From
    medical diagnosis to social media, the potential of machine learning to
    transform our world is truly mind-blowing.

    As technology evolves and the world's population grows, so does the amount
    of data being generated. Collecting, sorting, and analyzing all of this data
    can be pretty time-consuming; however, that's starting to change with the
    emergence of something called machine learning. Machine learning is a type
    of computer science that allows computer programs to learn and improve all
    on their own. In the past, computers could only do what we programmed them
    to do, but with machine learning, they can behave like humans and gain
    knowledge based on their past experiences. This process can get pretty
    complicated, but here's how it works on a basic level.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's say we want a program that can tell the difference between apples and
    bananas. First, we'll give it some labeled pictures of each. The program
    will then look for patterns in the fruits and start to remember them. It can
    then use these memories to look at unlabeled pictures of apples and bananas
    and determine which is which, all on its own.
  </p>
  <p>
    Believe it or not, you probably encounter machine learning on a daily basis.
    Social media sites use it to create your feed based on your preferences, and
    search engines use it to improve the accuracy of their search results. It's
    also being used on a larger scale. The medical industry is applying machine
    learning to things like predicting lifespans, organizing patient data, and
    even diagnosing certain diseases.
  </p>
  <p>
    As with many emerging technologies, there's a concern that machine learning
    may eliminate certain jobs. This will vary from industry to industry, but it
    does have the potential to get rid of or change a number of occupations,
    including drivers, bankers, and potentially even certain doctors. While it
    may have some negative effects, many believe that its positive applications
    will outweigh them. Goodwill Community Foundation is creating opportunities
    for a better life.
