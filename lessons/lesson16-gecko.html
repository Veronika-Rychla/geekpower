  <p>
    Meet Anne. She often shops from www.shoppingcart.com. She has her
    information like email ID, address and credit card details saved on the
    website to enable a faster and hassle-free shopping experience. The required
    information is stored in a server. One day, Anne received an email which
    stated her eligibility for a special discount voucher from shoppingcart.com.
    In order to receive the coupon code, she was asked to fill in her
    shoppingcart.com account credentials. This didn't seem fishy to her at the
    time as she thought it was just an account verification step. Little did she
    realize the danger she would be facing. She was knocked off her feet when a
    substantial amount of money was wiped off her account.
  </p>
  <p>
    How do you think this happened? Well, yes, the email she received was fake.
    Anne's shoppingcart.com account witnessed unauthorized access from a third
    party. This type of attack is known as a cyber attack and the person who
    carries it out is called a hacker. Could Anna have prevented this attack?
    Indeed, she could have with the help of cyber security.
  </p>
  <p>
    Cyber security involves techniques that help in securing various digital
    components, networks, data and computer systems from unauthorized digital
    access. There are multiple ways to implement cyber security depending on the
    kind of network you are connected to and the type of cyber attacks you are
    prone to. So, let's take a look at the various cyber attacks that Anne could
    have been exposed to. One of the most common types of cyber attacks is a
    malware attack like Trojan, adware and spyware to name a few. Had Anne
    downloaded any suspicious attachments online, her system could have gotten
    corrupted by certain malicious viruses embedded within the attachments.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next is a phishing attack, the type of cyber attack which Anne experienced.
    Here, the hacker usually sends fraudulent emails which appear to be coming
    from a legitimate source. This is done to install malware or to steal
    sensitive data like credit card information and login credentials. Another
    type of attack is the man-in-the-middle attack. Here, the hacker gains
    access to the information path between Anne's device and the website's
    server. The hacker's computer takes over Anne's IP address. By doing so, the
    communication line between Anne and the website is secretly intercepted.
    This commonly happens with unsecured Wi-Fi networks and also through
    malware.
  </p>
  <p>
    Password attack is one of the easiest ways to hack a system. Here, Anne's
    password could have been cracked by using either common passwords or trying
    all possible alphabetical combinations. To prevent future cyber attacks,
    Anne sought to implement a few cyber security practices. First, she
    installed a firewall. As the name suggests, it is a virtual wall between
    Anne's computer and the internet. Firewalls filter the incoming and outgoing
    traffic from your device to safeguard your network and they can either be
    software applications or hardware reinforcements.
  </p>
  <p>
    Secondly, Anne implemented honeypots. Just like how flowers attract bees,
    dummy computer systems called honeypots are used to attract attackers. These
    systems are made to look vulnerable in order to deceive attackers and this
    in turn defends the real system. In addition to these, she also decided to
    use unique alphanumeric passwords, antivirus software and started avoiding
    mails from unknown senders.
  </p>
  <p>
    That was Anne's story. Cyber attacks are not just confined to individuals
    but also to public and private organizations. The cyber attacks carried out
    in such places are more deadly and they result in colossal losses. Motives
    of such attacks are many, starting from tampering with crucial data to
    monetary gains. Let's have a look at a few of the cyber attacks that
    companies are subjected to. Various public sector organizations and large
    corporations face the Advanced Persistent Threat (APT). In this form of
    attack, hackers gain access to networks for a prolonged period in order to
    continuously gain confidential information.
  </p>
  <p>
    Companies also witness the Denial of Service Attack where networks are
    flooded with traffic which in turn leaves legitimate service requests
    unattended. A variant of this is the Distributed Denial of Service, a DDoS
    attack when multiple systems are used to launch the attack. When a hacker
    manipulates a standard SQL query in a database-driven website, it is known
    as an SQL Injection Attack. By doing so, hackers can view, edit, and delete
    tables from databases.
  </p>
  <p>
    Amidst a plethora of cyber attacks, it is indeed a challenge for
    organizations with several networks and servers to ensure complete security.
    This is not an easy task, and to help with this, cyber security
    professionals are hired to work on identifying cyber threats and securing a
    company's network.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are multiple job roles in the field of cyber security. If hacking
    fascinates you, then the role of an ethical hacker is something to be
    explored. Such professionals try to find a network's vulnerabilities just
    like how a hacker would do, but only to identify those vulnerabilities and
    resolve them for protection against an actual cyber attack. But if you are
    looking to design robust security structures, then the role of a security
    architect is more apt. A Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) plays a
    crucial role in enterprise security and is entrusted with the overall safety
    of the information in an organization.
