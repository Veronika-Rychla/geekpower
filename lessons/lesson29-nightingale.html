  <span class="brand__power">Grammar</span> - Neither, either, both
</h2>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  Neither a either se používají k vyjádření volby mezi dvěma možnostmi, ale
  každé z nich má odlišný význam a použití. "Neither" se používá k vyjádření
  negace obou možností, jako ve větě "Neither option is good," což znamená, že
  ani jedna možnost není dobrá. Naopak "either" se používá k vyjádření jedné
  možnosti z dvou, často s významem "jeden nebo druhý," jako ve větě "You can
  choose either option."
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  Pro české studenty může být těžké tato dvě slova správně používat, protože v
  češtině může být rozlišení mezi negací obou možností a volbou jedné z nich
  méně přímé nebo se může vyjadřovat jinými jazykovými prostředky, což může vést
  k záměně nebo nesprávnému použití těchto slov v anglickém kontextu. Pojďme se
  tedy podívat, jak na to.

  <span class="brand__power">Listening</span> - Mutually exclusive vs
  independent events
</h2>

  </div>

<div class="reading__text">
  <p>
    First, let's start with events being mutually exclusive. Basically, when two
    events are mutually exclusive from one another, those two events can't occur
    together. In other words, there is no intersection between these two events.
    Mathematically, this would be written as the probability of A and B equals
    zero. A good example of this comes in the form of flipping a coin. If we
    were to make one event flipping heads and the other event flipping tails,
    each event has a probability of 0.5 and they have no intersection because
    there's no possible way to flip a coin and have it land as both heads and
    tails. Therefore, these two events are mutually exclusive.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now that we covered that, let's move on to independence. When two events are
    independent of one another, the occurrence of one of those events has no
    effect on the occurrence of the other event. For example, if we were to look
    at the probability of it raining tomorrow as well as the probability of you
    smashing that like button to support us making these videos, we intuitively
    know that your much-appreciated button smashing has no effect on the
    weather. There is some probability that you liking this video will coincide
    with it raining tomorrow, but it would only be coincidence. So as a result,
    these events are independent of each other.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, unlike being mutually exclusive, this idea cannot be nicely
    visualized with a Venn diagram. Instead, we need to rely on mathematics to
    determine independence. Specifically, for independent events, the
    probability of both of those events happening is equal to the probability of
    the first event times the probability of the second event. Although this is
    the basis for determining independence, you may also see this idea written
    in a slightly different way. To see that, we need to look at the conditional
    formula that says the probability of A given B is the probability of A and B
    divided by the probability of B. And if you need a refresher on where this
    formula comes from, take a peek at our last video for a quick reminder.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, within our formula, we see this probability of A and B component. If A
    and B are independent, we can substitute in our independence formula to this
    equation and then cancel out the probability of B from the top and bottom to
    get that the probability of A given B is simply equal to the probability of
    A. And this makes sense. If the two events are independent and you are
    trying to find the probability of A occurring under the condition that B
    also occurs, well, it doesn't matter that B occurs since they're
    independent, so it just becomes the probability of A occurring. And this
    works the opposite way too. The probability of B given A just becomes the
    probability of B.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, if you take one thing from this video, remember that for mutually
    exclusive events, the probability of A and B occurring together is zero. And
    for independent events, the probability of A and B occurring together is the
    probability of A times the probability of B.
