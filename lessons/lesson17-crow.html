  <span class="brand__power">Grammar</span> - Muset nadvakrát
</h2>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  Slovesa <span class="example-underlined">have to</span> a
  <span class="example-underlined">must</span> se do češtiny obě překládají jako
  <span class="example-underlined">muset</span>, a i když je rozdíl mezi nimi
  jen velmi malý, používají se v odlišných kontextech. Obecně se však dá říct,
  že obě tato slovesa používají k
  <span class="example-underlined">vyjádření nutnosti nebo povinnosti</span>.
  Jak mezi nimi úspěšně rozlišovat?
</p>

<p class="lesson_paragraph expanded">🎯 Zdroj povinnosti</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  "Must" vyjadřuje spíše vnitřní povinnost nebo nutnost, kterou cítí mluvčí. Je
  to silný výraz, který se obvykle používá k zdůraznění osobního názoru nebo
  pocitu povinnosti. "Have to" obvykle vyjadřuje vnější povinnost, která je
  někým nebo něčím vnucena, například pravidly, zákony nebo okolnostmi.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 I must learn more about cybersecurity to better protect my clients' data. =
  já osobně to pociťuji jako nutnost
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 I must learn the latest programming languages to keep my skills sharp. =
  vnitřní nutkání
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 She must practice her coding regularly to master the new algorithms. =
  nikdo vnější ji do toho nenutí, sama má zájem
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 He must update his personal blog with the latest tech trends to engage his
  audience. = jeho osobní projekt, nikdo vnější ho do toho nenutí, vlastní
  nutnost
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 I must organize my project files better to improve my productivity. =
  šéfori to může být jedno, ale mně se bude lépe pracovat
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 She must attend the upcoming cybersecurity webinar to enhance her knowledge
  on the topic. = firma ji do toho nenutí, je to její vlastní zájem
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 You have to change your password every 90 days to comply with our IT
  security policy. = vnější nařízení
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 I have to work from 9 to 5 every day. = pracovní doba nucená
  zaměstnavatelem
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 I have to reset my password because I forgot it. = nucení vnějšími
  okolnostmi
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 She has to install the new security patch to protect her computer from
  viruses. = nucení vnějšími okolnostmi
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 We have to back up our files before the system upgrade tomorrow. = nařízení
  team leadera
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 You have to verify your email addresses to activate your accounts. =
  zákonitost systému
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 I have to charge my laptop; the battery is almost dead. = nucení vnější
  okolností
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 Employees have to complete cybersecurity training by the end of the
  quarter. = firma je do toho nutí

  systému
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 Users have to agree to the terms and conditions before using the software.
  = zákonitost systému
</p>

<p class="lesson_paragraph expanded">⏳ Časovost</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  "Must" se používá hlavně v přítomném a budoucím čase a nemá vlastní minulý
  tvar. K vyjádření minulosti se používá "had to". "Have to" se mění podle času
  ("have to" v přítomném, "had to" v minulém) a osoby ("has to" pro třetí osobu
  jednotného čísla).
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 She has to install the new security patch to protect her computer from
  viruses.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 The IT specialist has to verify the data backup process every week to
  ensure data integrity.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 My computer is really slow. It seem I'll have to buy a new one.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 Tomorrow, they will have to present the new software update to the team.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">🧩 I had to work overtime yesterday.</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 Yesterday, she had to update her computer to fix the security
  vulnerability.
</p>

<p class="lesson_paragraph expanded">❓ Otázky</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  K položení otázek se "must" používá méně často než "have to". Otázky s "have
  to" jsou běžnější a přirozenější, zvláště v hovorové angličtině.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 What do you have to learn to become a cyber security expert?
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 Do I have to restart my computer after installing the new software?
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 Do you have to enter a password every time you access the server?
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 Does he have to obtain approval for the new firewall settings?
</p>

<p class="lesson_paragraph expanded">🕵️‍♀️ Must pro logické dedukce</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  "Must" se v angličtině používá pro vyjádření silného přesvědčení nebo závěru
  na základě dostupných důkazů nebo logické dedukce. Když použijete "must" v
  tomto kontextu, dáváte najevo, že jste na základě pozorování nebo známých
  faktů došli k určitému závěru, i když nemáte přímý důkaz.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 The server is down; there must be a problem with the network.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 She's not responding to her emails; she must be in a meeting.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 The website is loading slowly; there must be a lot of traffic on it right
  now.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 He always fixes computer issues quickly; he must be very experienced with
  IT.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 They must be updating the app since it's not available in the store at the
  moment.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 The printer is out of toner; that must be why it's not printing correctly.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 She understood that complex programming concept right away; she must be
  very intelligent.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 We received an automated response; the customer service team must be very
  busy today.
</p>

<p class="lesson_paragraph expanded">❗ Mustn't ≠ don't have to ❗</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  Ačkoli mají slovesa must a have to ve svém kladném tvaru stejný význam, jejich
  zápory se od sebe razantně liší.
  <span class="example-underlined"
    >"Mustn't" vyjadřuje zákaz - tedy něco, co se nesmí dělat. Naproti tomu
    "don't have to" vyjadřuje, že něco není nutné dělat, protože to není
    povinné, ale člověk to klidně udělat může, pokud chce.</span
  >
</p>

<p class="lesson_paragraph marginer">
  <span class="example-underlined">Mustn't = nesmět</span> (striktní zákaz)
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 You mustn't share your password with anyone.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 Employees mustn't use company computers for playing video games.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 You mustn't install new software without first getting approval from IT
  support.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 We mustn't allow unauthorized users to access the admin panel.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 She mustn't leave her laptop unattended in public spaces to prevent theft.
</p>

<p class="lesson_paragraph marginer">
  <span class="example-underlined">Don't have to = nemuset</span> (ale klidně
  můžeš, pokud chceš)
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 You don't have to upgrade to the latest software if it doesn't suit your
  needs.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 They don't have to come to the office on weekends unless there is an urgent
  issue.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 You don't have to memorize your IP address; the network assigns it
  automatically.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 We don't have to stay late to finish the project; our deadline was
  extended.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 She doesn't have to check her emails while on vacation; the team will
  handle urgent matters.
</p>

<p class="lesson_paragraph expanded">🔥 Study skills tip 🔥</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  "Have to" se ve skutečnosti řadí do kategorie
  <span class="example-underlined">frázových modálních sloves</span>, což
  znamená, že má podobnou funkci jako modální slovesa, ale liší se od nich
  formou a použitím. Modální slovesa se v angličtině nečasují a nepřijímají
  infitivní "to" před následujícím plnovýznamových slovesem (must go, can see,
  may have.) "Have to" se chová více jako běžné sloveso, mění se podle osob
  ("has to" ve třetí osobě jednotného čísla) a časů ("had to" v minulém čase).

  <p>
    Python a high-level interpreted programming language famous for its zen-like
    code. It's arguably the most popular language in the world because it's easy
    to learn, yet practical for serious projects. In fact, you're watching this
    YouTube video in a Python web application right now. It was created by Guido
    van Rossum and released in 1991 who named it after Monty Python's Flying
    Circus which is why you'll sometimes find spam and eggs instead of foo and
    bar in code samples.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's commonly used to build server-side applications like web apps with the
    Django framework and is the language of choice for big data analysis and
    machine learning. Many students choose Python to start learning to code
    because of its emphasis on readability as outlined by the zen of Python =
    beautiful is better than ugly while explicit is better than implicit. Python
    is very simple but avoids the temptation to sprinkle in magic that causes
    ambiguity.
  </p>
  <p>
    Its code is often organized into notebooks where individual cells can be
    executed, then documented in the same place. We're currently at version 3 of
    the language and you can get started by creating a file that ends in .py or
    .ipymb to create an interactive notebook. Create a variable by setting a
    name equal to a value. It's strongly typed which means values won't change
    in unexpected ways but dynamic so type annotations are not required. The
    syntax is highly efficient, allowing you to declare multiple variables on a
    single line and define tuples, lists and dictionaries with a literal syntax.
  </p>
  <p>
    Semicolons are not required and if you use them, an experience Pythonista
    will say that your code is not Pythonic. Instead of semicolons, python uses
    indentation to terminate or determine the scope of a line of code. Define a
    function with the def keyword then indent the next line usually by four
    spaces to define the function body. We might then add a for-loop to it and
    indent that by another four spaces. This eliminates the need for curly
    braces and semicolons found in many other languages.
  </p>
  <p>
    Python is a multi-paradigm language. We can apply functional programming
    patterns with things like anonymous functions using lambda. It also uses
    objects as an abstraction for data, allowing you to implement
    object-oriented patterns with things like classes and inheritance. It also
    has a huge ecosystem of third-party libraries such as deep learning
    frameworks like Tensorflow and wrappers for many high performance low level
    packages like open Computer Vision which are most often installed with the
    Pip package manager.
