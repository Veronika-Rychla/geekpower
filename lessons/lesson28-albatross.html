  <p>
    Hi, my name is Mia Gil Epner. I'm majoring in Computer Science at UC
    Berkeley and I work for the Department of Defense where I try to keep
    information safe. The internet is an open and public system. We all send and
    receive information over shared wires and connections. Even though it's an
    open system, we still exchange a lot of private data - things like credit
    card numbers, bank information, passwords and emails. So how is all this
    private stuff kept secret?
  </p>
  <p>
    Data of any kind can be kept secret through a process known as encryption,
    descrambling or changing of the message to hide the original text. Now,
    decryption is the process of unscrambling that message to make it readable.
    This is a simple idea and people have been doing it for centuries. One of
    the first well-known methods of encryption was Caesar's cipher, named after
    Julius Caesar, a Roman general who encrypted his military commands to make
    sure that if a message was intercepted by enemies, they wouldn't be able to
    read it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Caesar's cipher is an algorithm that substitutes each letter in the original
    message with a letter a certain number of steps down the alphabet. If the
    number is something only the sender and receiver know, then it's called the
    key. It allows the reader to unlock the secret message. For example, if your
    original message is, "Hello", then, using the Caesar's cipher algorithm with
    a key of five, the encrypted message would be this. To decrypt the message,
    the recipient would simply use the key to reverse the process.
  </p>
  <p>
    But there's a big problem with Caesar's cipher. Anybody can easily break or
    crack the encrypted message by trying every possible key. In the English
    alphabet, there are only 26 letters, which means you'd only need to try, at
    most, 26 keys to decrypt the message. Trying 26 possible keys isn't very
    hard. It would take, at most, an hour to do. So let's make it harder.
  </p>
  <p>
    Instead of shifting every letter by the same amount, let's shift each letter
    by a different amount. In this example, a 10 digit key shows how many
    positions each successive letter will be changed to encrypt a longer
    message. Guessing this key would be really hard. Using 10 digit encryption,
    there could be 10 billion possible key solutions. Obviously, that's more
    than any human could ever solve. It would take many centuries, but an
    average computer today would take just a few seconds to try all 10 billion
    possibilities.
  </p>
  <p>
    So in a modern world, where the bad guys are armed with computers instead of
    pencils, how can you encrypt messages so securely that they're too hard to
    crack? "Too hard" means that there are too many possibilities to compute in
    a reasonable amount of time. Today's secure communications are encrypted
    using 256 bit keys. That means a bad guy's computer that intercepts your
    message would need to try this many possible options until they discover the
    key and crack the message.
  </p>
  <p>
    Even if you had a hundred thousand super computers, and each of them was
    able to try a million billion keys every second, it would take trillions of
    trillions of trillions of years to try every option, just to crack a single
    message protected with 256 bit encryption. Of course, computer chips get
    twice as fast, then half the size every year or so. If that pace of
    exponential progress continues, today's impossible problems will be solvable
    just a few hundred years in the future, and 256 bits won't be enough to be
    safe. In fact, we've already had to increase the standard key length to keep
    up with the speed of computers.
  </p>
  <p>
    The good news is, using a longer key doesn't make encrypting messages much
    harder, but it exponentially increases the number of guesses that it would
    to crack a cipher. When the sender and the receiver share the same key to
    scramble and unscramble a message, it's called symmetric encryption. With
    symmetric encryption, like Caesar's cipher, the secret key has to be agreed
    on ahead of time by two people in private.
  </p>
  <p>
    That's great for people, but the internet is open and public, so it's
    impossible for two computers to meet in private to agree on a secret key.
    Instead, computers use asymmetric keys, a public key that can be exchanged
    with anybody and a private key that is not shared. The public key is used to
    encrypt data and anybody can use it to create a secret message, but the
    secret can only be decrypted by a computer with access to the private key.
    How it works is with some math that we won't get into right now.
  </p>
  <p>
    Think of it this way, imagine that you have a personal mailbox where anybody
    can deposit mail, but they need a key to do it. Now, you could make many
    copies of the deposit key, and send one to your friend or even just make it
    publicly available. Your friend, or even a stranger, can use the public key
    to access your deposit slot and drop a message in, but only you can open the
    mailbox with your private key to access all of the secret messages you've
    received. You can send a secure message back to your friend by using the
    public deposit key to their mailbox. This way, people can exchange secure
    messages without ever needing to agree on a private key.
  </p>
  <p>
    Public key cryptography is the foundation of all secure messaging on the
    open internet including security protocols known as SSL and TLS which
    protect us when we're browsing the web. Your computer uses this today. Any
    time you see the little lock or the letters https in your browser's address
    bar, this means your computer is using public key encryption to exchange
    data securely with the website you're on.
  </p>
  <p>
    As more and more people get on the internet, more and more private data will
    be transmitted, and the need to secure that data will be even more
    important. As computers become faster and faster, we'll have to develop new
    ways to make encryption too hard for computers to break. This is what I do
    with my work, and it's always changing.
