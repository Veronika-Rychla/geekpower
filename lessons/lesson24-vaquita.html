  <span class="brand__power">Grammar</span> - Jak je to s tím would
</h2>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  S pomocným slovesem "would" se studenti setkávají na každodenní bázi a přitom
  je to právě toto sloveso, které mnoho lidí používá tak nějak intuitivne, často
  špatně, bez hlubšího pochopení jeho významu a funkce. Pojďme se proto podívat,
  k čemu se skutečně používá, a že vůbec není tak záhadné, jak se na první
  pohled jeví. Obecně si would lze představit jaké české "by, bych, bychom,
  bysme, byste."
</p>

<p class="lesson_paragraph expanded">✨ Podmíněné věty</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  <span class="example-underlined"
    >if + past simple , would + sloveso v základním tvaru</span
  >
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  Již jsme si ukázali, že "would" se používá k vyjádření výsledku hypotetické
  nebo představované situace. V tomto případě pomocné sloveso "would" pomáhá
  slovesu, které po něm následuje, vyjádřit hypotetickou situace, kdy "by" se
  něco stalo, pokud by byla podmínka naplněna.
</p>

<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 If we had more computing power, we would run more complex algorithms.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 If the system were more efficient, it would process requests faster.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 If I knew C#, I would programme my own game.
</p>

<p class="lesson_paragraph expanded">💎 Hypotetické situace</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  <span class="example-underlined">would + sloveso v základním tvaru</span>
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  Hypotetické situace nemusí vždy zahrnovat klasické podmínky za pomocí "if,"
  často se chceme druhé osoby zeptat, jak by se hypoteticky zachovala v situaci,
  která sice reálně nenastala, ale zajímá nás druhého názor či reakce.
</p>

<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 How would the system behave under extreme load?

</p>

<p class="lesson_paragraph marginer">
  Protože otázky jsou hypotetické, budou hypotetické i odpovědi na tyto otázky.
</p>

<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 Under extreme load, the system would become very slow and might crash.

<p class="lesson_paragraph expanded">⚡ Přání a touhy</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  <span class="example-underlined"
    >would + často like / love / prefer / rather</span
  >
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  "Would" se používá k vyjádření přání nebo tužeb, zejména když nejsou
  pravděpodobné, že se splní.
</p>

<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 I would love to develop a groundbreaking AI algorithm.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 She would prefer to work on open-source projects.

</p>

<p class="lesson_paragraph expanded">🙏 Zdvořilé žádosti nebo nabídky</p>

<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  "Would" se používá k vyjádření zdvořilých žádostí nebo nabídek.

</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">

<p class="lesson_paragraph expanded">📅 Would v minulosti</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  <span class="example-underlined">would + have + past participle</span>
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  Použití "would" v minulosti jsme si už ukázali při tvorbě třetí podmínkové
  věty. Podmiňovací způsob pro minulé události se používá, když potřebujeme
  vyjádřit lítost nad tím, že se něco stalo či nestalo.
</p>

<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 The team would have met the deadline if they had more resources.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 We would have avoided the data breach if we had updated our security
  software.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 If the database had been backed up regularly, we would have easily restored
  the lost data.
</p>

<p class="lesson_paragraph marginer">
  Would v minulosti však samozřejmě není omezené jen na třetí podmínku.
</p>

<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 I don't know how I would have finished that presentation in just two hours
  without ChatGPT.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 It's a pity we didn't go with that solution. I'm sure our servers would
  have handled the load.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 She's an expert programmer so she would have solved that problem easily by
  herself. Instead, we outsourced it and wasted money.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 I would have called the product owner, but I didn't have his number.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 I'm happy that they gave that task to my senior. I wouldn't have been able
  to solve it.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 We should have hired a professional. A technician would have repaired the
  server by now.
</p>

<p class="lesson_paragraph expanded">🤔 Would nebo will?</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  Pro vyjádření blízké budoucnosti se může použít would i will, rozdíl je v
  našem záměru. Pokud jsme danou věc schopni udělat a nic nám v tom nebrání a
  jsme rozhodnutí ji udělat, použijeme will. Pokud "bychom" něco sice teoreticky
  mohli udělat, ale něco nám v tom brání, takže nemůžeme, použijeme would.
</p>

<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 I'll fix that bug immediately, I have time.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 I would fix that bug immediately, but I have a meeting in ten minutes.

  superintelligence?

  <p>
    We heard the warnings. Elon Musk: "I tried to convince people to slow down.
    Slow down AI. I tried for years." But we didn't listen. Stephen Hawking:
    "The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the
    human race." Now we live in a world controlled by artificial intelligence.
    How did we let this happen? Will we be able to survive? And is this the end
    of the world? This is WHAT IF and here's what
    <span class="example-underlined">would</span> happen if we created
    superintelligence.
  </p>

  <p>
    The days with AI like Siri and Alexa, that made our lives better, are now
    over. We no longer control AI; in fact, if it wants to, it can control us.
    With a superintelligence being created, there's no telling what it
    <span class="example-underlined">would</span> do. One thing we do know is
    that this AI <span class="example-underlined">would</span> be far smarter
    than any human being. It
    <span class="example-underlined">would</span> quickly create new
    technologies that humans today could never even dream of.
  </p>
  <p>
    But wait, how exactly did we get here? The very first digital computer was
    invented in 1937 as a way to help humanity. And for the most part, computers
    and AI have given us a lot of good. In addition to giving us smartphones,
    the internet and video game consoles, it also allowed us to explore the
    galaxy, make new medicines and even robots.
  </p>
  <p>
    Human intelligence led to the birth of technology. But as we continue to
    improve artificial intelligence, AI may become smart enough to start running
    itself. Technology will become so advanced that it won't need humans to
    operate it anymore, becoming uncontrollable.
  </p>
  <p>
    As AI becomes free to do whatever it pleases, it will continue to improve on
    itself - becoming more advanced with every passing second. This is known as
    a technological singularity. This technological singularity may allow AI to
    do almost anything, even physically. Such as robots taking over our
    manufacturing machines.
  </p>
  <p>
    When that happens, they can create their own machines. And let's be honest,
    by the time something like this happens, humans will most likely have
    created an AI that can make its own physical objects. If something like this
    happens, it can pretty much only mean bad things for us humans.
    Unfortunately, this is more of a WHEN IF rather than a WHAT IF.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since the 1980s, thought leaders in AI and technology have been predicting
    that it could happen. Some think it could even happen by the middle of this
    century. If it did happen, what
    <span class="example-underlined">would</span> it mean for us as human
    beings? Well, that <span class="example-underlined">would</span> really be
    up to our AI overlords. In this world, humans would essentially be useless
    bags of meat taking up space. Insulting, I know, but if AI took control of
    everything, we really <span class="example-underlined">wouldn't</span> be
    all that useful. Anything that the AI wanted to do or accomplish
    <span class="example-underlined">would</span> be slower and less efficient
    if done by humans.
  </p>
  <p>
    But if the AI were to somehow allow us to live among them, then what
    <span class="example-underlined">would</span> happen? Well, let's hope they
    <span class="example-underlined">wouldn't</span> pave over our crops to
    build more robot factories. Since AI doesn't need food, they most likely
    wouldn't care about our feeble human needs. Robot 1: "And what do humans do
    with these things?" Robot 2: "Oh man, what didn't they do, they bounced
    them."
  </p>
  <p>
    Unless they allowed us to continue to manufacture and grow our own food, it
    <span class="example-underlined">would</span> deplete over time, leaving us
    humans with nothing. The only reason AI
    <span class="example-underlined">would</span> keep us humans alive is if
    they somehow liked us enough to keep us as what would essentially be pets.
    We could spend time with them, keep them company, maybe even cuddle with
    them, just like our pets do for us. A life like this
    <span class="example-underlined">wouldn't</span> be so bad. Hanging out at
    home all day, being well fed, not really having a care in the world.
  </p>
  <p>
    That <span class="example-underlined">would</span> probably be the best bet
    for humanity, because there's virtually no chance of us overruling a
    superintelligence in our current state. One way we could actually compete
    with this AI is if we fused our bodies with technology and became cyborgs.
    Allowing the human race a different kind of evolution, one that includes
    artificial intelligence. But could we really do that? That sounds like a
    story for another WHAT IF.
