<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  Third Conditional se používá k diskusi
  <span class="example-underlined"
    >o minulých situacích, které se nestaly, a jejich hypotetických
    výsledcích</span
  >. Jedná se o způsob, jak si představit jiný výsledek, než jaký ve skutečnosti
  nastal. Tato forma je zvláště užitečná pro přemýšlení o promeškaných
  příležitostech, představování alternativních scénářů a pochopení důsledků
  akcí, které nebyly provedeny.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  <span class="example-underlined"
    >If + past perfect, would have + základní tvar slovesa</span
  >
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  Vedlejší věta (podmínka) začíná slovíčkem "if" a používá past perfect
  (předminulý čas). Popisuje podmínku, která nenastala.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">If I had known about the meeting...</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  Hlavní věta (výsledek) typicky používá gramatickou strukturu "would have"
  následovanou třetím minulým tvarem slovesa. Hlavní věta popisuje hypotetický
  výsledek dané podmínky.

  Pro IT profesionály je zvládnutí třetí podmínky velmi užitečné zvláště v
  kontextech, kde je běžné analyzovat minulé události, řešit problémy nebo
  přemýšlet o alternativních řešeních a výsledcích.
  <span class="example-underlined">Analýza projektů po jejich dokončení:</span>
  Po dokončení projektu IT profesionálové často přezkoumávají, co šlo dobře a co
  ne. <span class="example-underlined">Řešení problémů a diagnostika:</span> Při
  diagnostice problémů IT profesionálové často hypotetizují o minulých akcích a
  jejich dopadu.
</p>

<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 If we had allocated more resources to the testing phase, we might have
  identified the bug earlier.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 If we had chosen a different software architecture, our system would have
  been more scalable.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 If the user hadn't ignored the update notifications, they wouldn't have

</p>

<p class="lesson_paragraph marginer">
  <span class="example-underlined">Učení se z chyb:</span> V IT je klíčové učení
  se z minulých chyb. Třetí podmínka pomáhá artikulovat získané lekce.

    These days, we spend a lot of time looking at screens: computers,
    smartphones, and televisions are a big part of our lives. They're how we get
    most of our news, use social media, watch movies, and more. Virtual reality
    and augmented reality are two technologies changing the way we use screens,
    creating new and exciting interactive experiences.
  </p>
  <p>
    Virtual reality, also known as VR, uses a headset with a built-in screen
    that displays a virtual environment for you to explore. These headsets use a
    technology called head tracking, which allows you to look around the
    environment by simply moving your head.
  </p>
  <p>
    Augmented reality, or AR, is a bit different. Instead of transporting you to
    a virtual world, it takes digital images and layers them on the real world
    around you. This is done through the use of either a clear visor or a
    smartphone. So, with VR, you could explore a world full of dinosaurs, but
    with AR, you could see those dinosaurs moving through the world around you.
  </p>
  <p>
    Both of these technologies are growing at a rapid pace and being implemented
    in a variety of different ways. Surgeons are using VR to practice highly
    technical surgeries before operating. Businesses are using them to give
    consumers virtual tours of products and locations. There are even apps that
    can use your smartphone's camera to scan and translate a foreign language in
    real time. As they continue to grow, VR and AR have the potential to greatly
    change almost every industry. You'll want to keep an eye on them to see how
    they might soon affect your job and potentially your everyday life.

<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  📝 Napište 10 vět s použitím třetí podmínky. Přemýšlejte o proběhlých dějích,
  kterých teď zpětně litujete, a přemýšlejte o alternativních koncích, kdybyste
  jen tehdy něco udělali jinak, ale minulost už bohužel nezměníte. 😩

<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 If Tom had backed up his files before the system update, he wouldn't have
  lost all his important project documents.

<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 If Lisa had remembered to change her passwords frequently, her accounts
  wouldn't have been hacked so easily.

  🧩 If Alex had double-checked the code for errors, he wouldn't have spent
  hours debugging the application the night before the deadline.
