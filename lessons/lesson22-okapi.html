  Third Conditional se používá k diskusi o minulých situacích, které se nestaly,
  a jejich hypotetických výsledcích. Jedná se o způsob, jak si představit jiný
  výsledek, než jaký ve skutečnosti nastal. Tato forma je zvláště užitečná pro
  přemýšlení o promeškaných příležitostech, představování alternativních scénářů
  a pochopení důsledků akcí, které nebyly provedeny.
