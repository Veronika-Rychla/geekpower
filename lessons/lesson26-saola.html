<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  Přídavná jména končící na "-ed" a "-ing" hrají klíčovou roli v popisu pocitů,
  stavů a charakteristik. Zatímco přídavná jména s koncovkou "-ed" obvykle
  vyjadřují, jak se někdo cítí nebo je ovlivněn určitou situací či činností,
  přídavná jména s "-ing" popisují vlastnosti nebo účinky něčeho, co tyto pocity
  nebo stavy vyvolává.

    For most of our history, human technology consisted of our brains, fire, and
    sharp sticks. While fire and sharp sticks became power plants and nuclear
    weapons, the biggest upgrade has happened to our brains. Since the 1960's,
    the power of our brain machines has kept growing exponentially, allowing
    computers to get smaller and more powerful at the same time. But this
    process is about to meet its physical limits. Computer parts are approaching
    the size of an atom. To understand why this is a problem, we have to clear
    up some basics.
  </p>
  <p>
    A computer is made up of very simple components doing very simple things.
    Representing data, the means of processing it and control mechanisms.
    Computer chips contain modules, which contain logic gates, which contain
    transistors. A transistor is the simplest form of a data processor in
    computers, basically a switch that can either block, or open the way for
    information coming through. This information is made up of bits which can be
    set to either 0 or 1. Combinations of several bits are used to represent
    more complex information. Transistors are combined to create logic gates
    which still do very simple stuff. For example, an AND Gate sends an output
    of 1 if all of its inputs are 1, and a output of 0 otherwise. Combinations
    of logic gates finally form meaningful modules, say, for adding two numbers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once you can add, you can also multiply, and once you can multiply, you can
    basically do anything. Since all basic operations are literally simpler than
    first grade math, you can imagine a computer as a group of 7-year-olds
    answering really basic math questions. A large enough bunch of them could
    compute anything from astrophysics to Zelda. However, with parts getting
    tinier and tinier, quantum physics are making things tricky. In a nutshell,
    a transistor is just an electric switch. Electricity is electrons moving
    from one place to another. So, a switch is a passage that can block
    electrons from moving in one direction.
  </p>
  <p>
    Today, a typical scale for transistors is 14 nanometers, which is about 8
    times less than the HIV virus' diameter and 500 times smaller than a red
    blood cell. As transistors are shrinking to the size of only a few atoms,
    electrons may just transfer themselves to the other side of a blocked
    passage via a process called Quantum Tunneling. In the quantum realm,
    physics works quite differently from the predictable ways we're used to and
    traditional computers just stop making sense. We are approaching a real
    physical barrier for our technological progress. To solve this problem,
    scientists are trying to use these unusual quantum properties to their
    advantage by building quantum computers.
  </p>
  <p>
    In normal computers, bits are the smallest unit of information. Quantum
    computers use qubits which can also be set to one of two values. A qubit can
    be any two level quantum system, such as a spin and a magnetic field, or a
    single photon. 0 and 1 are this system's possible states, like the photons
    horizontal or vertical polarization. In the quantum world, the qubit doesn't
    have to be just one of those, it can be in any proportions of both states at
    once. This is called superposition.
  </p>
  <p>
    But as soon as you test its value, say, by sending the photon through a
    filter, it has to decide to be either vertically or horizontally polarized.
    So as long as it's unobserved, the qubit is in a superposition of
    probabilities for 0 and 1, and you can't predict which it'll be. But the
    instant you measure it, it collapses into one of the definite states.
    Superposition is a game changer. Four classical bits can be in one of two to
    the power of four different configurations at a time. That's 16 possible
    combinations, out of which you can use just one. Four qubits in
    superposition, however, can be in all of those 16 combinations at once. This
    number grows exponentially with each extra qubit. Twenty of them can already
    store a million values in parallel.
  </p>
  <p>
    A really weird and unintuitive property qubits can have is Entanglement, a
    close connection that makes each of the qubits react to a change in the
    other's state instantaneously, no matter how far they are apart. This means
    that when measuring just one entangled qubit, you can directly deduce
    properties of its partners without having to look.
  </p>
  <p>
    Qubit Manipulation is a mind bender as well. A normal logic gate gets a
    simple set of inputs and produces one definite output. A quantum gate
    manipulates an input of superpositions, rotates probabilities, and produces
    another superposition as its output. So a quantum computer sets up some
    qubits, applies quantum gates to entangle them and manipulate probabilities,
    then finally measures the outcome, collapsing superpositions to an actual
    sequence of 0s and 1s.
  </p>
  <p>
    What this means is that you get the entire lot of calculations that are
    possible with your setup, all done at the same time. Ultimately, you can
    only measure one of the results and it'll only probably be the one you want,
    so you may have to double check and try again. But by cleverly exploiting
    superposition and entanglement, this can be exponentially more efficient
    than would ever be possible on a normal computer.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, while quantum computers will probably not replace our home computers, in
    some areas, they are vastly superior. One of them is database searching. To
    find something in a database, a normal computer may have to test every
    single one of its entries. Quantum computers algorithms need only the square
    root of that time, which for large databases, is a huge difference.
  </p>
  <p>
    The most famous use of quantum computers is ruining IT security. Right now,
    your browsing, email, and banking data is being kept secure by an encryption
    system in which you give everyone a public key to encode messages only you
    can decode. The problem is that this public key can actually be used to
    calculate your secret private key. Luckily, doing the necessary math on any
    normal computer would literally take years of trial and error. But a quantum
    computer with exponential speed-up could do it in a breeze.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another really exciting new use is simulations. Simulations of the quantum
    world are very intense on resources, and even for bigger structures, such as
    molecules, they often lack accuracy. So why not simulate quantum physics
    with actual quantum physics? Quantum simulations could provide new insights
    on proteins that might revolutionize medicine. Right now, we don't know if
    quantum computers will be just a specialized tool, or a big revolution for
    humanity. We have no idea where the limits of technology are and there's
    only one way to find out.
