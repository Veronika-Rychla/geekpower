</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  üß© The timeline shows all the important dates in history.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  üß© We created a project timeline to track our progress.
</p>

<p class="lesson_paragraph expanded">‚è∞ Checklist ‚è∞</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  A list of items required, things to be done, or points to be considered. It is
  a simple list of items or tasks to be checked off when completed.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  üß© I have a checklist of things to pack for my trip.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  üß© Before starting the engine, the pilot goes through a checklist.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  üß© Make sure to complete everything on your homework checklist.

    When it comes to AI, machine learning, and deep learning, there is some
    confusion as to what these words mean and the differences between them. So,
    in this video, we will explain what AI means and how to differentiate
    between these three terms.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, what is artificial intelligence? In the broader sense of the word,
    artificial intelligence refers to a machine that is made to simulate human
    consciousness. When the average person thinks of AI, they imagine robots
    that can see, move, speak, think and possibly even feel the way humans do.
    For some, the ultimate goal of AI research is to create a sentient,
    conscious being through programming. Sometimes this is also referred to as
    artificial general intelligence.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, in practice, most data scientists are using AI at a smaller, more
    practical scale to solve real-world problems such as data analysis,
    manufacturing and customer service. In that sense, AI is the umbrella term
    for technology that solves problems autonomously by simulating human
    intelligence.
  </p>
  <p>
    They do this through algorithms designed to analyze input data and produce
    an output. Using chatbots, for example, the input data would be the
    customer's inquiry and the output would be the answer to the customer's
    inquiry held within the chatbot's database. What's more amazing is that AI
    algorithms can react to input data in various forms.
  </p>
  <p>
    A great example is how you would ask a virtual assistant like Amazon Alexa
    or Google Assistant for the weather report. There are multiple ways that you
    can phrase that query, such as "what's the weather," "what's the
    temperature," or even "how's the weather looking." But by picking up on
    certain keywords, the virtual assistant can respond to all these different
    variants. "The current weather is 23 degrees Celsius with clear skies."
  </p>
  <p>
    So, if that's the definition of AI, then how is machine learning different?
    Well, machine learning is generally considered to be a subset of AI.
    However, it's pretty common to hear the two terms used interchangeably. One
    major difference is that while AI still encompasses the idea of a sentient,
    conscious machine, machine learning as a term does not hold those
    connotations. AI is the grand vision of intelligent machines, while machine
    learning consists of the models, processes and supporting technology that
    we've been using to get there.
  </p>
  <p>
    Diving a bit deeper now, within machine learning is another sector known as
    deep learning. In a nutshell, deep learning is machine learning at the
    largest scale, involving millions of instances of training data and often
    multiple layers within the neural network. As computing power and access to
    training data has increased, researchers have been able to develop machine
    learning models on a larger scale than ever before. Eventually, this led to
    the use of a new term, deep learning.
  </p>
  <p>
    To fully understand its meaning, it's essential to first know a little bit
    about neural networks. Simply, a neural network is a collection of
    algorithms designed to take in data and find a solution with the least
    amount of error. They are called neural networks because the design of the
    nodes, inputs, and outputs slightly resemble that of a neuron in the human
    brain. The key differentiator between machine learning and deep learning is
    in the number of layers of nodes that the input data passes through. In the
    past, it was only possible to connect a few layers of nodes due to simple
    computing limitations. However, as technology has improved, it has become
    possible to build deeper neural networks with more hidden layers. This is
    the kind of model data scientists mean when they talk about deep learning.
  </p>
  <p>
    To sum things up, AI is the grand all-encompassing vision of intelligent
    machines and machine learning is the processes and tools that are getting us
    there. Finally, deep learning is machine learning at the largest scale with
    more sophisticated neural networks, exponentially larger data sets and
    stronger computing power supporting it. With this in mind, it's possible to
    begin navigating through this complex exciting field and figuring out which
    processes will help to build out your own project.
