  <span class="brand__power">Grammar</span> - Budoucnost záměru a schylování
</h2>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  Přítomný průběhový se nejlépe hodí pro vyjádření budoucnosti, která se určitě
  stane, protože jsme buď na 100% rozhodnuti nebo pro to máme nějakou formu
  důkazu (nakoupené letenky, schůzku v kalendáři, termín u lékaře). Co když ale
  chceme vyjádřit náš
  <span class="example-underlined"
    >záměr něco udělat, který ještě není pevným plánem</span
  >
  nebo <span class="example-underlined">situace, ke kterým se schyluje</span>? K
  tomu použijeme jednoduchou vazbu
  <span class="example-underlined">be going to + sloveso v základním tvaru</span
  >.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph expanded">
  💪 Budoucnost záměru - rozhodli jsme se něco udělat a opravdu to chceme
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  Představte si situaci, kdy opravdu hodně chcete navštívit nějakou vysněnou
  destinaci nebo konferenci a chcete tam jet příští rok. Ještě však nemáte
  letenky ani odložené peníze a váš
  <span class="example-underlined">záměr je sice silný</span> a už ho v hlavě
  nosíte nějakou dobu,
  <span class="example-underlined">ale ještě není pevným plánem</span>. I když
  to opravdu chcete provést a nejspíš to i uděláte, nemůžete ještě říct, že se
  to stane na 100%. V českém překladu si záměr můžeme představit jako
  <span class="example-underlined">chci něco udělat</span>.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 I'm going to visit Japan next year. = Příští rok chci navštívit Japonsko.
  Je to naším silným záměrem, ale ještě jsme pro to nic reálně neudělali.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 I'm visiting Japan next year in May. = Příští rok jedu do Japonska. Už mám
  nakoupené letenky a určitě jedu.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 I'm going to attend FrontKon in October. = V říjnu se chci zúčastnit
  FrontKonu. Opravdu se toužím zúčastnit, ale ještě nemám lístek, takže je
  možné, že to nevyjde.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 I'm attending FrontKon in October. = V říjnu jdu na FrontKon. Lístek mám
  zajištěný.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 We are going to launch the new software next month. = máme v záměru
  vypustit nový program příští měsíc, ale ještě nemáme pevné datum a je možné,
  že dojde k odkladu
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 I am going to write a script to automate that task. = určitě to mám v
  úmyslu, ale ještě nemám pevný plán
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 They are going to upgrade the server infrastructure in the third quarter. =
  IT oddělení to chce udělat, ale znáte to, dokud není deadline... 😅
</p>

<p class="lesson_paragraph marginer">
  Pomocí going to se můžeme jednoduše ptát druhých, co chtějí udělat. Musí
  přitom jít o
  <span class="example-underlined"
    >promyšlené záměry a ne spotánní rozhodnutí na místě</span
  >.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 Are you going to implement that bug fix now? = Máš to v záměru
  implementovat teď?
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 Is she going to attent PyCon? = Chce a je jejím záměrem jít na PyCon?
  Protože nevíme, jestli už listek má nebo ne, nemůžeme použít přítomný
  průběhový.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 Are you going to eat that sandwich? = Chceš jíst ten sendvič/máš to v
  úmyslu? Pokud ne, tak ho chci já! 😎
</p>

<p class="lesson_paragraph expanded">👀 Pozorujeme, že se k něčemu chyluje</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  Going to můžeme úspěšně aplikovat i na takové
  <span class="example-underlined"
    >budoucí situace, u kterých pozorujeme, že se k nim pomalu ale jistě
    schyluje, a máme pro to jasné důkazy</span
  >. Jde o formu budoucnosti, která není ani záměrem (záměr může mít jen osoba o
  něco usilující) ani plánem (často to buď nechceme nebo výsledek neovlivníme),
  ale není ani spontánní.
</p>

<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 It's going to rain. = pozorujeme, jak se obloha zatahuje
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 My collagues is going to have a baby. = už to jde na kolegyňce vidět 🤰
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 The server is going to crash if we don't address the memory issue. = z
  diagnostiky jsme vypozorovali, že se k tomu schyluje
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 Given the current bugs, the software release is going to be delayed. = máme
  jasné indikace, které nasvědčují, že se schyluje k odkladu
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 He hasn't backed up his data, and he is going to lose everything if his
  hard drive fails. = Kolega tohle určitě nechce, ale my pozorujeme, že si
  nezálohuje data, a tak se schyluje k tomu, že o ně přijde.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph expanded">🔥 Study skills tip 🔥</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  Pokud vám pochopení schylování se činí potíže, zkuste následující metodu.
  Rozhlédněte se okolo sebe, projděte se po bytě, vykoukněte z okna. K čemu se
  pomalu ale jistě schyluje?
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 It's going to snow. = vykoukneme z okna a vidíme šedé naducané mraky 🌨
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 Judging by the error messages, the system is going to need a reboot. = máme
  důkaz v hromadě chybových hlášek
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 The hard drive is going to malfunction soon; it's already making strange
  noises. = důkaz slyšíme
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 With all these background processes running, the computer is going to
  overheat. = bojíme se, že k tomu dojde, máme pro to pádné důkazy
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 Are we going to have chicken for lunch? = Ucítíme, že partner/partnerka v
  kuchyni peče maso a voní jako kuře. Nemůžems si být zcela jistí (jinak bychom
  použili přítomný průběhový), ale nejspíš se k tomu schyluje.

    When it comes to AI, machine learning, and deep learning, there is some
    confusion as to what these words mean and the differences between them. So,
    in this video, we will explain what AI means and how to differentiate
    between these three terms.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, what is artificial intelligence? In the broader sense of the word,
    artificial intelligence refers to a machine that is made to simulate human
    consciousness. When the average person thinks of AI, they imagine robots
    that can see, move, speak, think and possibly even feel the way humans do.
    For some, the ultimate goal of AI research is to create a sentient,
    conscious being through programming. Sometimes this is also referred to as
    artificial general intelligence.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, in practice, most data scientists are using AI at a smaller, more
    practical scale to solve real-world problems such as data analysis,
    manufacturing and customer service. In that sense, AI is the umbrella term
    for technology that solves problems autonomously by simulating human
    intelligence.
  </p>
  <p>
    They do this through algorithms designed to analyze input data and produce
    an output. Using chatbots, for example, the input data would be the
    customer's inquiry and the output would be the answer to the customer's
    inquiry held within the chatbot's database. What's more amazing is that AI
    algorithms can react to input data in various forms.
  </p>
  <p>
    A great example is how you would ask a virtual assistant like Amazon Alexa
    or Google Assistant for the weather report. There are multiple ways that you
    can phrase that query, such as "what's the weather," "what's the
    temperature," or even "how's the weather looking." But by picking up on
    certain keywords, the virtual assistant can respond to all these different
    variants. "The current weather is 23 degrees Celsius with clear skies."
  </p>
  <p>
    So, if that's the definition of AI, then how is machine learning different?
    Well, machine learning is generally considered to be a subset of AI.
    However, it's pretty common to hear the two terms used interchangeably. One
    major difference is that while AI still encompasses the idea of a sentient,
    conscious machine, machine learning as a term does not hold those
    connotations. AI is the grand vision of intelligent machines, while machine
    learning consists of the models, processes and supporting technology that
    we've been using to get there.
  </p>
  <p>
    Diving a bit deeper now, within machine learning is another sector known as
    deep learning. In a nutshell, deep learning is machine learning at the
    largest scale, involving millions of instances of training data and often
    multiple layers within the neural network. As computing power and access to
    training data has increased, researchers have been able to develop machine
    learning models on a larger scale than ever before. Eventually, this led to
    the use of a new term, deep learning.
  </p>
  <p>
    To fully understand its meaning, it's essential to first know a little bit
    about neural networks. Simply, a neural network is a collection of
    algorithms designed to take in data and find a solution with the least
    amount of error. They are called neural networks because the design of the
    nodes, inputs, and outputs slightly resemble that of a neuron in the human
    brain. The key differentiator between machine learning and deep learning is
    in the number of layers of nodes that the input data passes through. In the
    past, it was only possible to connect a few layers of nodes due to simple
    computing limitations. However, as technology has improved, it has become
    possible to build deeper neural networks with more hidden layers. This is
    the kind of model data scientists mean when they talk about deep learning.
  </p>
  <p>
    To sum things up, AI is the grand all-encompassing vision of intelligent
    machines and machine learning is the processes and tools that are getting us
    there. Finally, deep learning is machine learning at the largest scale with
    more sophisticated neural networks, exponentially larger data sets and
    stronger computing power supporting it. With this in mind, it's possible to
    begin navigating through this complex exciting field and figuring out which
    processes will help to build out your own project.
