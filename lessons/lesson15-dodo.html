  <span class="brand__power">Grammar</span> - Možná, můžeš, aby, když už...
</h2>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  Dalšími modálními slovesy, na které se v této lekci zaměříme, jsou
  <span class="example-underlined">may</span> a
  <span class="example-underlined">might</span>. Tato slovesa mají daleko širší
  využití, než jste si nejspíš mysleli, a dají se použít k
  <span class="example-underlined"
    >vyjádření možností, svolení, účelu i k návrhům</span
  >. Z gramatického hlediska se chovají stejně jako can a could, takže
  postrádají obvyklou časovost, a často se dají s can a could zaměnit, aniž by
  věta dramaticky změnila význam.
</p>

<p class="lesson_paragraph expanded">💪 Possibility = něco je možné</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  Chceme vyjádřit, že něco je možné, ale není to jisté.
  <span class="example-underlined"
    >Obecný pravidlem je, že might vyjadřuje menší šanci, že se něco stane, než
    may,</span
  >
  podobně jako could má menší pravděpodobnost než can. V určitých případech may
  a might mohou kontextově odkazovat na budoucnost. ➰
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 There may be a bug in the system. = jen spekulujeme, jistě nevíme
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 Our new colleague may come to the party tonight. = Je možné, že přijde, ale
  není to jisté.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 The server may experience downtime during the maintenance window tonight. =
  ale možná k tomu nakonec nedojde
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 Due to the recent software update, users may notice the app running faster.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 The new patch might fix the security vulnerability we identified last week.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">

  heavy load.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">

<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 The integration of the two platforms might lead to some initial
  synchronization issues.
</p>

<p class="lesson_paragraph expanded">🙏 Permission = svolení</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  Dáváme povolení k činnosti nebo o povolení zdvořile žádáme. V tomto kontextu
  je možné libovolně zaměnit s "can," aniž by věta změnila význam.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 May I push the newest version to the repository?

<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  Pomocí "may" je možné šikovně vyjádřit účel nebo specifický způsob, jak něco
  udělat.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">

</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 Considering the consistent feedback about the app's slow performance, we
  might as well allocate resources to optimize its speed in the next sprint
</p>

<p class="lesson_paragraph expanded">❌ Might not/may not</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  Záporné tvary těchto modálních sloves sice mají své stažené podoby, v současné
  době se však už téměř nikdy nepoužívají, a proto není třeba se je učit.

  restrictions.
</p>

<p class="lesson_paragraph expanded">🤔 May be nebo maybe?</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  I když tato slovíčka vypadají téměř identicky, a proto je studenti často
  zaměňují, jde ve skutečnosti o dva odlišné slovní druhy. Modální sloveso "may"
  ve spojitosti s "be" je modální sloveso následované plnovýznamovým slovesem
  "být" zatímco
  <span class="example-underlined"
    >"maybe" psané dohromady je příslovce znamenající "možná"</span
  >
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 The unexpected system shutdown may be related to the recent software
  update.

  last week.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 Maybe we should consider migrating to a different cloud provider.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 If the code keeps returning errors, maybe there's an issue with the
  libraries we're using.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 I received a notification about a system update; maybe that will fix the
  compatibility issues we've been facing.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 I've heard about a new cybersecurity tool; maybe we can test it out next
  month.
</p>

  from the UX team.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 I can't access the shared drive; maybe there are permission settings that
  need to be adjusted.

  <p>
    Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML, is a language that defines the structure
    of content on a webpage. Development started in 1989 at CERN by Tim
    Berners-Lee, who had just invented the world's first web browser, World Wide
    Web, the origin of WWW, but he needed a publishing language to display
    content within it. So, he chose a syntax based on the Standard Generalized
    Markup Language, which uses opening and closing tags to provide meaning to
    otherwise unorganized text, like "h" for heading, "p" for paragraph, and
    most importantly, "a" for anchor to link to a different web page.
  </p>
  <p>
    The language underwent many changes during the initial rise of the internet
    and was standardized as HTML5 in 2008, the version we know and love today.
    Modern HTML contains tags to handle a variety of different media types, like
    video, audio, and canvas to draw custom graphics on the fly.
  </p>
  <p>
    The typical HTML element starts with an opening and closing tag. In the
    middle, we have content which might be text or additional HTML elements
    called children. The opening tag may also have one or more attributes, which
    are key-value pairs that can customize the appearance or behavior of the
    element.
  </p>
  <p>
    To build your first web page, create a file named index.html. This file
    contains a hierarchy of nodes based on the Document Object Model, or DOM. A
    webpage starts with an HTML tag and has exactly two children: a head and a
    body. The head contains things that aren't directly shown in the webpage,
    like a title or a meta tag to give the page a description. But notice how
    the meta element has no closing tag.
  </p>
  <p>
    Closing tags are generally optional when an element is fully self-contained.
    The body contains the actual UI for the end user. We might start with an h1
    heading, followed by a paragraph of content. To add an image, we use an
    image tag, which you'll notice is self-closing. Then, define the source
    attribute as the file path to the image, and you'll want to give it an alt
    description to make it accessible to robots and screen readers.
  </p>
  <p>
    What makes web pages revolutionary, though, is their ability to link to
    other web pages on the information super highway. Use an anchor tag to
    create a link, then define the href attributes as the webpage that you want
    to navigate to when clicked.
  </p>
  <p>
    HTML also provides structural tags like division, or div, which are often
    used to group elements together where they can be styled to represent
    complex UI elements like navbars. When you're happy with your code, grab the
    full file path to the HTML file and paste it into any web browser.
    Congratulations, you just built your first website.
