  <span class="brand__power">Grammar</span> - Like vs As
</h2>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  Zaměňování "like" s "as" a naopak je velmi častou a "oblíbenou" chybou. 😅
  Pojďme si na tento gramatický jev posvítit a jednou pro vždy si v něm udělat
  pořádek.
</p>

<p class="lesson_paragraph expanded">✨ Like pro podobnost mezi dvěmi věcmi</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  <span class="example-underlined">like + podstatné jméno/zájmeno</span>
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  Nějaké dvě věci jsou si v určitém aspektu podobné, vidíme souvislost, a tak je
  můžeme připodobnit.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 Working on a complex code is like solving a puzzle. = připodobnění kódování
  k řešení rébusů
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 Debugging this code is like looking for a needle in a haystack.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 Her laptop works like a super computer after the upgrade. = pouhé
  připodobnění, samozřejmě se super počítačem nestal, ale rozdíl oproti
  původnímu stavu je ohromující
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 Using this software is like having a virtual assistant. = ve skutečnosti
  ale daný software virtuálním asistentem v pravém slova smyslu není
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 Working with this outdated software is like trying to run a marathon with
  weights on your feet.
</p>

<p class="lesson_paragraph expanded">🎆 As / as pro porovnání dvou věcí</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  <span class="example-underlined">as + přídavné jméno/příslovce + as</span>
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  Buď pro "obrazné" (někdy až básnické) připodobnění nebo přímé srovnání dvou
  věcí.
</p>

<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 The server is as essential as the heart in a human body. = velmi obrazné
  přirovnání
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 This software is as efficient as the previous version. = přímé srovnání s
  předchozí verzí
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 He is as careful as a database manager. = ale ve skutečnosti není správce
  databáze, jen je tak pečlivý, jak by se čekalo od správce
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 The server room is as cold as an icebox to protect the equipment. = pouhé
  obrazné přirovnání
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 This database is organized as neatly as a library. = přirovnáváme databázi
  ke knihovně
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 Their server security is as strong as a fortress. = přirovnáváme bezpečnost
  serveru k pevnosti
</p>

<p class="lesson_paragraph expanded">👩‍🏫 As pro popis role nebo funkce</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  <span class="example-underlined">as + podstatné jméno</span>
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph"></p>

<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 She works as a database administrator. - Here, "as" is used to describe her
  job function.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 He works as a software developer in a multinational company.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 As a data analyst, he spends most of his day mining and interpreting data.
</p>

<p class="lesson_paragraph expanded">🙄 Nadužívání "like" v neformální řeči</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  <span class="example-underlined"
    >she was like... and I was like... you have to, like, go for it</span
  >
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  Relativně často se můžete setkat s fenoménem, kdy mluvčí (ať už rodilí nebo
  studenti) nadužívají slovíčko "like" a používají ho jako vatu, když se neumí
  vymáčknout. Takového vyjadřování vede k nejasnému projevu a neprofesionálnímu
  vyjadřování.
</p>

<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 It's like, when you code, you have to, like, think ahead.
</p>

<p class="lesson_paragraph expanded">📌 Někdy záleží na kontextu!</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  Někdy se můžeme dostat do situace, kdy sice neuděláme gramatickou chybu jako
  takovou, protože jsou ve větě možné obě varianty, ale věta má pak zcela jiný
  význam, na což si musíme dát obzvlášť pozor, protože to může vést k
  nedorozuměmí.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 She works as a software developer. = Tato věta jasně říká, že pracuje jako
  softwarová vývojářka, je to její oficiální role, dostává za to zaplaceno, má
  to v popisu práce.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 She works like a software developer. = Naproti tomu tato věta naznačuje, že
  sice některé aspekty její práce připomínají práci softwarové vývojářky (třeba
  styl, jakým přistupuje k problémům, jak uchopuje úkoly, logická řešení), ale
  ve skutečnosti softwarovou vývojářkou není. V tomto případě jen připodobňujeme
  styl její práce k jinému povolání.

  <p>
    Imagine a future where your toaster anticipates what kind of toast you want.
    During the day, it scans the Internet for new and exciting types of toast.
    Maybe it asks you about your day, and wants to chat about new achievements
    in toast technology. At what level would it become a person? At which point
    will you ask yourself if your toaster has feelings? If it did, would
    unplugging it be murder? And would you still own it? Will we someday be
    forced to give our machines rights?
  </p>
  <p>
    AI is already all around you. It makes sure discounters are stocked with
    enough snacks, it serves you up just the right Internet ad, and you may have
    even read a new story written entirely by a machine. Right now we look at
    chat bots like Siri and laugh at their primitive simulated emotions, but
    it's likely that we will have to deal with beings that make it hard to draw
    the line between real and simulated humanity. Are there any machines in
    existence that deserve rights? Most likely, not yet. But if they come, we
    are not prepared for it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Much of the philosophy of rights is ill-equipped to deal with the case of
    Artificial Intelligence. Most claims for right, with a human or animal, are
    centered around the question of consciousness. Unfortunately, nobody knows
    what consciousness is. Some think that it's immaterial, others say it's a
    state of matter, like gas or liquid. Regardless of the precise definition,
    we have an intuitive knowledge of consciousness because we experience it. We
    are aware of ourselves and our surroundings, and know what unconsciousness
    feels like. Some neuroscientists believe that any sufficiently advanced
    system can generate consciousness. So, if your toaster's hardware was
    powerful enough, it may become self-aware. If it does, would it deserve
    rights?
  </p>
  <p>
    Well, not so fast. Would what we define as "rights" make sense to it?
    Consciousness entitles beings to have rights because it gives a being the
    ability to suffer. It means the ability to not only feel pain, but to be
    aware of it. Robots don't suffer, and they probably won't unless we
    programmed them to. Without pain or pleasure, there's no preference, and
    rights are meaningless.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our human rights are deeply tied to our own programming, for example we
    dislike pain because our brains evolved to keep us alive. To stop us from
    touching a hot fire, or to make us run away from predators. So we came up
    with rights that protect us from infringements that cause us pain. Even more
    abstract rights like freedom are rooted in the way our brains are wired to
    detect what is fair and unfair.
  </p>
  <p>
    Would a toaster that is unable to move, mind being locked in a cage? Would
    it mind being dismantled, if it had no fear of death? Would it mind being
    insulted, if it had no need for self-esteem? But what if we programmed the
    robot to feel pain and emotions? To prefer justice over injustice, pleasure
    over pain and be aware of it? Would that make them sufficiently human?
  </p>
  <p>
    Many technologists believe that an explosion in technology would occur, when
    Artificial Intelligence can learn and create their own Artificial
    Intelligences, even smarter than themselves. At this point, the question of
    how our robots are programmed will be largely out of our control.
  </p>
  <p>
    What if an artificial intelligence found it necessary to program the ability
    to feel pain, just as evolutionary biology found it necessary in most living
    creatures? Do robots deserve those rights? But maybe we should be less
    worried about the risk that super-intelligent robots pose to us, and more
    worried about the danger we pose to them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our whole human identity is based on the idea of human exceptionalism, that
    we are special unique snowflakes, entitled to dominate the natural world.
    Humans have a history of denying that other beings are capable of suffering
    as they do. In the midst of the Scientific Revolution, René Descartes argued
    animals were mere automata―robots if you will. As such, injuring a rabbit
    was about as morally repugnant as punching a stuffed animal. And many of the
    greatest crimes against humanity were justified by their perpetrators on the
    grounds that the victims were more animal than civilized human.
  </p>
  <p>
    Even more problematic is that we have an economic interest in denying robot
    rights. If can coerce a sentient AI―possibly through programmed torture―into
    doing as we please, the economic potential is unlimited. We've done it
    before, after all. Violence has been used to force our fellow humans into
    working. And we've never had trouble coming up with ideological
    justifications.
  </p>
  <p>
    Slave owners argued that slavery benefited the slaves: it put a roof over
    their head and taught them Christianity. Men who were against women voting
    argued that it was in women's own interest to leave the hard decisions to
    men. Farmers argue that looking after animals and feeding them justifies
    their early death for our dietary preferences. If robots become sentient,
    there will be no shortage of arguments for those who say that they should
    remain without rights, especially from those who stand to profit from it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Artificial intelligence raises serious questions about philosophical
    boundaries. What we may ask if sentient robots are conscious or deserving of
    rights, it forces us to pose basic questions like, what makes us human? What
    makes us deserving of rights? Regardless of what we think, the question
    might need to be resolved in the near future.
