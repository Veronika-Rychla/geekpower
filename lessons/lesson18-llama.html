  <span class="brand__power">Grammar</span> - Modální slovesa v minulosti
</h2>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  I když jsem vám až doposud tvrdila, že modální slovesa netvoří minulé časy (a
  skutečně napřímo netvoří, jedinou výjimkou je can -> could), ve skutečnosti
  existuje možnost, jak je do minulosti převést. Opět musíme využít třetích
  tvarů sloves a trochu si pomoci předpřítomností.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph expanded">🙄 Promarněné možnosti v minulosti</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  Can je jediné modální sloveso s nativní minulostí, jehož minulým tvarem je
  <span class="example-underlined">could</span>. I tento modál však dokáže (a v
  některých případech vyloženě musí) využít služeb předpřítomného tvaru, aby
  dokázal vyjádřit pravděpodobnost v minulosti.
</p>

<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 When I was at university, I could code for hours without taking a break. =
  nativní podoba slovesa can vyjadřující schopnost v minulosti (no problem 😎)
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 I'm so exhausted after our project's deadline that I could sleep for a
  week. = jsme vyčerpaní v současnosti a mluvíme jen čistě hypoteticky, proto si
  vystačíme s could
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 The software upgrade could have improved system efficiency, but it's a
  failure.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 Our team could have implemented a more robust encryption method, but we
  didn't have money for it.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 A cloud-based solution could have offered more scalability. = ale nakonec
  jsme se rozhodli do tohoto řešení bohužel nejít
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 Regular backups could have safeguarded against data loss. = s křížkem po
  funuse, data jsou ztracena
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 A more intuitive user interface could have improved customer satisfaction.
  = ale my jsme to odflákli
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 A thorough code review could have identified potential vulnerabilities. =
  stěžujeme si zpětně, co se udělalo špatně
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 Expanding the beta testing group could have provided more diverse feedback.
  = ale už je na to pozdě
</p>

<p class="lesson_paragraph expanded">🤔 Spekulace o minulosti</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  Pomocí may/might + have + past participle můžeme vyjadřovat spekulace o
  minulosti.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 The server downtime may have been caused by unexpected traffic.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 Our recent software update might have resolved the compatibility issues.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 The client's feedback may have been influenced by the new interface design.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 The decrease in load time might have been a result of the database
  optimization.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 The increase in user engagement may have been a result of the recent
  feature additions.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 The smooth integration of the third-party API might have contributed to the
  system's overall performance.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 The positive response from beta testers might have been due to
  user-friendly navigation.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 The successful data migration may have been due to thorough planning and
  execution.
</p>

<p class="lesson_paragraph expanded">😅 Neudělali jsme něco, co jsme měli</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  Pokud jsme neudělali něco, co jsme měli (a ve výsledku to bylo špatně), můžeme
  směle využít should. Často k vyjádření lítosti nad stavem věci v současnosti.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 We should have backed up the data before starting the system upgrade.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 The team should have tested the new security patch in a controlled
  environment first.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 I should have documented the code changes more thoroughly for future
  reference.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 They should have consulted with the end-users before redesigning the user
  interface.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 Our network administrator should have monitored the system for anomalies
  more frequently.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 We should have implemented a more advanced encryption method for sensitive
  data.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 The project manager should have scheduled regular meetings to ensure better
  coordination.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 Management should have allocated more resources to the cybersecurity team.
</p>

<p class="lesson_paragraph expanded">🤨 Asi to tak muselo být</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  Must můžeme použít pro logické dedukce o minulosti, kterým opravdu věříme.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 The sudden increase in server load must have been caused by the new feature
  release.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 The system's rapid response time must have been a result of the latest
  optimization.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 Our security measures must have successfully blocked the attempted cyber
  attack.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 The bug fix must have resolved the issue since no further errors were
  reported.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 The database's quick recovery after the crash must have been due to the
  robust backup protocol.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 The high user engagement on the platform must have been influenced by the
  recent UI/UX improvements.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 The efficient data handling in the new software must have been the result
  of advanced algorithms.
</p>
