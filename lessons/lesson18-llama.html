  <span class="brand__power">Grammar</span> - Modální slovesa v minulosti
</h2>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  I když jsem vám až doposud tvrdila, že modální slovesa netvoří minulé časy (a
  skutečně napřímo netvoří, jedinou výjimkou je can -> could), ve skutečnosti
  existuje možnost, jak je do minulosti převést. Opět musíme využít třetích
  tvarů sloves a trochu si pomoci předpřítomností.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph expanded">🙄 Promarněné možnosti v minulosti</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  Can je jediné modální sloveso s nativní minulostí, jehož minulým tvarem je
  <span class="example-underlined">could</span>. I tento modál však dokáže (a v
  některých případech vyloženě musí) využít služeb předpřítomného tvaru, aby
  dokázal vyjádřit pravděpodobnost v minulosti.
</p>

<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 When I was at university, I could code for hours without taking a break. =
  nativní podoba slovesa can vyjadřující schopnost v minulosti (no problem 😎)

<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 I'm so exhausted after our project's deadline that I could sleep for a
  week. = jsme vyčerpaní v současnosti a mluvíme jen čistě hypoteticky, proto si
  vystačíme s could

<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 The software upgrade could have improved system efficiency, but it's a
  failure.

<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 Our team could have implemented a more robust encryption method, but we
  didn't have money for it.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 A cloud-based solution could have offered more scalability. = ale nakonec
  jsme se rozhodli do tohoto řešení bohužel nejít
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 Regular backups could have safeguarded against data loss. = s křížkem po
  funuse, data jsou ztracena
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 A more intuitive user interface could have improved customer satisfaction.
  = ale my jsme to odflákli
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 A thorough code review could have identified potential vulnerabilities. =
  stěžujeme si zpětně, co se udělalo špatně
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">

  <span class="brand__power">Listening</span> - What is BIOS?

  <p>
    What is the BIOS, CMOS, and UEFI? That's what we're going to talk about in
    this video. BIOS stands for basic input/output system. The BIOS is firmware
    that's built into the motherboard that initializes the computer's hardware
    as the computer is being booted. And then after it initializes the hardware,
    it then searches for a boot device, such as an optical drive or a storage
    drive, to boot software such as an operating system.
  </p>
  <p>
    From the start, when you first turn on the computer, the computer does
    what's called a power-on self-test or POST, which is run by the BIOS. It
    tests the computer to make sure all the requirements are met and if the
    hardware is working correctly before starting the operating system. If the
    computer passes the test, the internal speaker will make a short single beep
    which indicates that the computer has passed the test and is booting up
    normally.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, if there are no beeps or multiple beeps then that means that the
    computer has failed the test and something is wrong and the computer needs
    further troubleshooting to find out what the problem is. Whether there are
    no beeps or multiple beeps, the computer will generate a beep code to help
    you pinpoint the problem. For example, if the computer generates three long
    beeps, then that could indicate a keyboard error. Or if the computer
    generates a continuous short beep, then that could indicate a problem with a
    RAM module.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whatever BIOS is installed on the computer's motherboard, you can always
    refer to the manufacturer's documentation to find a list of beep codes and
    what they mean so you can pinpoint the problem and correct it. The BIOS
    software is stored on the BIOS chip on the motherboard. The BIOS chip is
    non-volatile, which means that the contents of a chip are retained even
    after the power is turned off. But even after the computer is turned off,
    the computer does need to maintain certain settings, such as the date and
    time, the boot sequence, and certain hardware settings. In other words, the
    custom settings that you have configured in the BIOS.
  </p>

    software is stored on the BIOS chip on the motherboard. The BIOS chip is
    non-volatile, which means that the contents of a chip are retained even
    after the power is turned off. But even after the computer is turned off,
    the computer does need to maintain certain settings, such as the date and
    time, the boot sequence, and certain hardware settings. In other words, the
    custom settings that you have configured in the BIOS.
  </p>
  <p>
    And these settings are stored on the motherboard in a special chip called a
    CMOS chip but, unlike the BIOS chip which is non-volatile, the CMOS chip is
    volatile, meaning that it needs constant power to maintain its contents or
    settings. In order for the CMOS to maintain its settings while the computer
    is turned off, it uses a battery and this battery is called the CMOS
    battery.
  </p>
  <p>
    The CMOS battery is a small button cell battery which can be seen on the
    surface of the motherboard and it's usually located on the bottom righthand
    corner and it's basically the same type of battery that is typically used in
    wristwatches. As I stated before, the CMOS needs constant power that is
    supplied by the battery. But if the battery is removed and then reattached,
    the BIOS will reset back to its default settings from the manufacturer and
    erase any custom settings that you have configured.
  </p>
  <p>
    A lot of people get confused about what's the difference between the BIOS
    and CMOS and these terms are often used to refer to the same thing, but they
    are different. So just to clarify things, the BIOS is the actual firmware or
    program that comes with your motherboard and that firmware is stored in the
    BIOS chip. But the settings that you actually make to the BIOS, such as a
    date and time, the boot sequence, fan speeds, and things like that, those
    settings are retained in the CMOS chip.
  </p>
  <p>
    The CMOS chip is not necessarily its own chip. On modern motherboards, it's
    been integrated with the real-time clock that's part of the southbridge
    chipset. A new type of BIOS is called UEFI. UEFI stands for unified
    extensible firmware interface. Now most if not all new motherboards are
    shipped with this newer type of BIOS.
  </p>
  <p>
    UEFI has several advantages over the old BIOS and the first and most
    obvious, just by looking at it, is that it has a user-friendly graphical
    user interface that supports different colours and even animations whereas
    the old BIOS has your typical blue screen that resembles the windows blue
    screen of death.
  </p>
  <p>
    UEFI can also recognize larger storage drives and you can even use a mouse
    in the UEFI interface, whereas compared to the old BIOS, where mouse support
    wasn't even available and you had to use your keyboard only. UEFI also has a
    built-in feature called secure boot and secure boot stops any digitally
    unsigned drivers from loading and it also helps to stop malicious software
    such as rootkits.
