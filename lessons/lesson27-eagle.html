  <span class="brand__power">Grammar</span> - Když potřebujeme více přídavných
  jmen
</h2>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  Často se ocitneme v situaci, kdy potřebujeme podstatné jméno blíže definovat
  více než jedním přídavným jménem. V angličtině jsou přídavná jména řazena
  podle velmi specifické hierarchie a její nedodržení může mít za následek sice
  pro druhého jakž takž srozumitelnou, ale krkolomnou větu. Jak na to?
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph expanded">✨ Nejdřív pocity, až potom fakta</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  <span class="example-underlined"
    >pocitové přídavné jméno + faktuální přídavné jméno + podstatné jméno</span
  >
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  Pokud máme jedno přídavné jméno vyjadřující náš názor či pocit ohledně dané
  věci a druhé vyjadřující fakt o dané věci (velikost, věk, barva, materiál...),
  přídavné jméno našeho subjektivního názoru vyjádříme vždy jako první a teprve
  potom přistupujeme k faktům.

    How long do you think it will take before machines do your job better than
    you do? Automation used to mean big stupid machines doing repetitive work in
    factories. Today they can land aircraft, diagnose cancer and trade stocks.
    We are entering a new age of automation unlike anything that's come before.
    According to a 2013 study, almost half of all jobs in the US could
    potentially be automated in the next two decades. But wait! Hasn't
    automation been around for decades? What's different this time?
  </p>
  <p>
    Things used to be simple. Innovation made human work easier and productivity
    rose which means that more staff or services could be produced per hour
    using the same amount of human workers. This eliminated many jobs, but also
    created other jobs that were better which was important because the growing
    population needed work. So, in a nutshell, innovation, higher productivity,
    fewer old jobs and many new and often better jobs. Overall, this worked well
    for a majority of people and living standards improved.
  </p>
  <p>
    There's a clear progression in terms of what humans did for a living. For
    the longest time, we worked in agriculture. With the Industrial Revolution,
    this shifted into production jobs and as automation became more widespread,
    humans shifted into service jobs. And then, only a few moments ago in human
    history, the Information Age happened. Suddenly, the rules were different.
    Our jobs are now being taken over by machines much faster than they were in
    the past. That's worrying of course, but innovation will clearly save us,
    right?
  </p>
  <p>
    While new information age industries are booming, they are creating fewer
    and fewer new jobs. In 1979, General Motors employed more than 800,000
    workers and made about $11 billion US dollars. In 2012, Google made about
    $14 billion US dollars while employing 58,000 people. You may not like this
    comparison, but Google is an example of what created new jobs in the past:
    innovative new industries.
  </p>
  <p>
    Old innovative industries are running out of steam. Just look at cars. When
    they became a thing 100 years ago, they created huge industries. Cars
    transformed our way of life, our infrastructure and our cities. Millions of
    people found jobs either directly or indirectly. Decades of investment kept
    this momentum going. Today, this process is largely complete. Innovation in
    the car industry does not create as many jobs as it used to. While electric
    cars are great and all, they won't create millions of new jobs. But wait!
    What about the internet?
  </p>
  <p>
    Some technologists argue that the Internet is an innovation on a par of the
    introduction of electricity. If we go with this comparison, we see how our
    modern innovation differs from the old one. The Internet created new
    industries, but they're not creating enough jobs to keep up with population
    growth or to compensate for the industries the Internet is killing.
  </p>
  <p>
    At its peak in 2004, Blockbuster had 84,000 employees and made $6 billion US
    dollars in revenue. In 2016, Netflix had 4,500 employees and made $9 billion
    dollars in revenue. Or take us, for example. With a full-time team of just
    12 people, Kurzgesagt reaches millions of people. A TV station with the same
    amount of viewers needs way more employees. Innovation in the Information
    Age doesn't equate to the creation of enough new jobs, which would be bad
    enough on its own, but now a new wave of automation and a new generation of
    machines is slowly taking over.
  </p>
  <p>
    To understand this, we need to understand ourselves first. Human progress is
    based on the division of labor. As we advanced over thousands of years, our
    jobs became more and more specialized. While even our smartest machines are
    bad at doing complicated jobs, they are extremely good at doing narrowly
    defined and predictable tasks. This is what destroyed factory jobs.
  </p>
  <p>
    But look at a complex job long and hard enough and you'll find that it's
    really just many narrowly defined and predictable tasks one after another.
    Machines are on the brink of becoming so good at breaking down complex jobs
    into many predictable ones, that for a lot of people, there will be no
    further room to specialize. We are on the verge of being outcompeted.
  </p>
  <p>
    Digital machines do this via machine learning which enables them to acquire
    information and skills by analyzing data. This makes them become better at
    something through the relationships they discover. Machines teach
    themselves. We make this possible by giving a computer a lot of data about
    the thing we wanted to become better at. Show a machine all the things you
    bought online and it will slowly learn what to recommend to you, so you buy
    more things.
  </p>
  <p>
    Machine learning is now meeting more of its potential because, in recent
    years, humans have started to gather data about everything. Behavior,
    weather patterns, medical records, communication systems, travel data, and
    of course, data about what we do at work. What we've created by accident is
    a huge library machines can use to learn how humans do things and learn to
    do them better. These digital machines might be the biggest job killer of
    all. They can be replicated instantly and for free. When they improve, you
    don't need to invest in big metal things; you can just use the new code. And
    they have the ability to get better fast. How fast? If your work involves
    complex work on a computer today, you might be out of work even sooner than
    the people who still have jobs in factories.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are actual real-world examples of how this transition might be
    happening. A San Francisco company offers a project management software for
    big corporations, which is supposed to eliminate middle management
    positions. When it's hired for a new project, the software first decides
    which jobs can be automated and precisely where it needs actual professional
    humans. It then helps assemble a team of freelancers over the Internet. The
    software then distributes tasks to the humans and controls the quality of
    the work, tracking individual performance until the project is complete.
    Okay, this doesn't sound too bad.
  </p>
  <p>
    While this machine is killing one job, it creates jobs for freelancers,
    right? Well, as the freelancers complete their tasks, learning algorithms
    track them and gather data about their work and which tasks it consists of.
    So what's actually happening is that the freelancers are teaching a machine
    how to replace them. On average, this software reduces costs by about 50% in
    the first year and by another 25% in the second year. This is only one
    example of many. There are machines and programs getting as good or better
    than humans in all kinds of fields. From pharmacists to analysts,
    journalists to radiologists, cashiers to bank tellers, or the unskilled
    workers flipping burgers. All of these jobs won't disappear overnight, but
    fewer and fewer humans will be doing them. We'll discuss a few cases in a
    follow-up video.
  </p>
  <p>
    But while jobs disappearing is bad, it's only half of the story. It's not
    enough to substitute old jobs with new ones. We need to be generating new
    jobs constantly because the world population is growing. In the past, we
    have solved this through innovation. But, since 1973, the generation of new
    jobs in the US has begun to shrink.
  </p>
  <p>
    And the first decade of the 21st century was the first one where the total
    amount of jobs in the US did not grow for the first time. In a country that
    needs to create up to 150,000 new jobs per month, just to keep up with
    population growth, this is bad news. This is also starting to affect
    standards of living. In the past, it was seen as obvious that with rising
    productivity, more and better jobs would be created, but the numbers tell a
    different story.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 1998, US workers worked a total of 194 billion hours. Over the course of
    the next 15 years, their output increased by 42 percent. But in 2013, the
    amount of hours worked by US workers was still 194 billion hours. What this
    means is that despite productivity growing drastically, thousands of new
    businesses opening up and the US population growing by over 40 million,
    there was no growth at all in the number of hours worked in 15 years. At the
    same time, wages for new university graduates in the US have been declining
    for the past decade while up to 40 percent of new graduates are forced to
    take on jobs that don't require a degree.
  </p>
  <p>
    Productivity is separating from human labor. The nature of innovation in the
    Information Age is different from everything we've encountered before. This
    process started years ago and is already well underway. Even without new
    disruptions like self-driving cars, or robot accountants. It looks like
    automation is different this time. This time, the machines might really take
    our jobs. Our economies are based on the premise that people consume. But if
    fewer and fewer people have decent work, who will be doing all the
    consuming? Are we producing ever more cheaply only to arrive at a point
    where too few people can actually buy all our stuff and services? Or, will
    the future see a tiny minority of the super rich who own the machines
    dominating the rest of us? And does our future really have to be that grim?
  </p>
  <p>
    While we were fairly dark in this video, it's far from certain that things
    will turn out negatively. The Information Age and modern automation could be
    a huge opportunity to change human society and reduce poverty and inequality
    drastically. It could be a seminal moment in human history. We'll talk about
    this potential, and possible solutions like a universal basic income, in
    part 2 of this video series. We need to think big and fast. Because one
    thing's for sure: the machines are not coming, they are already here.
