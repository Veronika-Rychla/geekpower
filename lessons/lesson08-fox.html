  <span class="brand__power">Grammar</span> - Opakované činnosti v minulosti
</h2>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  Opakované činnosti v minulosti jsou dalším příkladem toho, proč si nevystačíme
  s pouze s minulým časem prostým. Past simple totiž umí vyjádřit pouze
  jednorázové činnosti, a tak se nehodí pro činnosti, které trvaly delší dobu
  (past continuous) a už vůbec ne na opakované činnosti. Proč jsou zrovna ty tak
  problematické? Protože potřebujeme sdělit, že jsme nejenom něco dělali, ale že
  jsme to dělali opakovaně, ať už byl interval jakýkoli. Do češtiny by se něco
  takového doslova překložilo jako "dělávat" namísto "dělat." Zvažte následující
  situaci:
</p>

<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 She <span class="example-underlined">works</span> as a programmer. = V
  současnosti pracuje jako programátorka. Protože jde o věc obecně pravivou,
  použijeme přítomný čas.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 She <span class="example-underlined">switched</span> jobs two years ago. =
  Před dvěma lety změnila práci. Jednorázová záležitost, past simple se tedy
  perfektně hodí.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 She <span class="example-underlined">used to teach</span> at secondary
  school. = Doslovný překlad by zněl: Učívávala na střední. Samozřejmě můžeme
  tuto větu přeložit i jednodušeji jako: "Učila na střední."
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph marginer">
  Důležité v případě used to je, že se skutečné jedná o opakované činnosti v
  minulosti. Teoreticky byste mohli namítnout, proč nepoužít minulý čas
  průběhový, ten však opakovanost nevyjadřuje a věta bude mít zcela jiné
  vyznění.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 She <span class="example-underlined">was teaching</span> ICT for three
  weeks. = Tři týdny vyučovala informatiku, nicméně z věty není jasné, jestli
  byla skutečně učitelkou informatiky nebo jen zaskakovala za nemocného kolegu.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 She <span class="example-underlined">used to teach</span> ICT. = Učívavala
  informatiku. Bala skutečně učitelkou informatiky, dělala to opakovaně.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph marginer">
  Protože je sloveso "být" speciální snad úplně všude, je možné si v případě
  tohoto slovesa situaci nekomplikovat a jsou tedy možné obě varianty. Slovesu
  <span class="example-underlined">to be</span> tohle bez problémů projde,
  protože <span class="example-underlined">vyjadřuje stav a ne činnost</span>.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 She <span class="example-underlined">was</span> an ICT teacher. = Byla
  učitelkou informatiky.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 She <span class="example-underlined">used to be</span> an ICT teacher. =
  Bývavala učitelkou informatiky. Význam je zcela stejný.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph marginer">
  V případě ostatních sloves však musíme pečlivě rozlišovat, co vlastně chceme
  sdělit.
  <span class="example-underlined"
    >Used to totiž vyjadřuje opakující se činnosti, které v součastnosti už
    neděláme, kdežto past simple jen sděluje, co jsme v minulosti udělali a
    možná to stále děláme.</span
  >
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 She <span class="example-underlined">used to play</span> a lot of
  videogames. = Hrávávala hodně videoher, ale v součastnosti už ne.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 She <span class="example-underlined">played</span> a lot of videogames. =
  Podáváme jen prostou informaci, že má odehráno opravdu hodně videoher. Jestli
  dodnes hraje nebo ne, bez kontextu nezjistíme.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph marginer">
  Used to se tedy perfektně hodí v případech, kdy potřebujeme sdělit, že něco
  nějak bylo v minulosti, ale v současnosti tomu tak už není. Past simple se k
  tomuto účelu nehodí, protože sice říká, co se v minulosti odehrálo, ale
  neobsahuje meziřádkovou informaci o tom, jestli je tomu teď jinak.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 He <span class="example-underlined">coded</span> a lot of websites. =
  Nakódoval hromadu webu, ale dělá to stále? Nevíme.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 He <span class="example-underlined">used to code</span> a lot, mainly
  websites. = Hodně v minulosti kódoval, hlavně weby, ale už se tomu dnes
  nevěnuje.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph expanded">🚴‍♀️ Návyky v minulosti</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  Used to se svým charakterem výtečně hodí k vyjádření návyků, které jsme v
  minulosti pravidelně provozovali, ale dnes už je neděláme. Když použijeme used
  to, náš posluchač má hned jasno v tom, že dnes je tomu jinak.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 He <span class="example-underlined">used to play</span> football. = Hrával
  fotbal, dnes už ne.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 She <span class="example-underlined">used to wake up</span> before six
  before she became a programmer. = Vstávala před šestou, dnes už ne.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 I <span class="example-underlined">used to read</span> a lot of books. = I
  když explicitně neřeknu, že dnes třeba nemám tolik času, z věty je jasné, že
  už tolik nečtu.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph marginer">
  Samozřejmě můžeme mluvit i o věcech, které jsme v minulosti nedělali, ale teď
  je vše jinak.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">
  🧩 I <span class="example-underlined">didn't use to do</span> any sports at
  school, but now I try to exercise regularly.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph examples">

  English, but these days he's trying to listen to English audiobooks.

  <p>
    Bill Gates, a co-founder of Microsoft and philanthropist. William Bill Henry
    Gates was born on October 28th, 1955 in an upper-middle-class family in
    Seattle, Washington. An avid reader, Gates excelled at Lakeside School and
    did very well in many subjects. In the eighth grade, the mothers' club at
    the school purchased a teletype terminal and a block of time on the school's
    computer. Gates would spend as much time as he could on the computer and
    wrote his first program at the age of 13. A tic-tac-toe program in basic
    computer language that allowed users to play against the computer. In 1973,
    he graduated from school with a score of 1590 out of 1600 on his SAT tests.
  </p>
  <p>
    During his time at school, Gates had befriended Paul Allen over their love
    of computers. They had built a computer program based on the Intel 8008 chip
    called Traf-O-Data that monitored traffic patterns in Seattle. Although
    Gates had acquired a place at Harvard University to study law, he would
    eventually drop out in 1975 to pursue a business with Allen. Gates and Allen
    were inspired by an article in Popular Electronics magazine on the Altair
    8800, a build-it-yourself kit microcomputer.
  </p>
  <p>
    They contacted the company who made the Altair, called Micro Instrumentation
    and Telemetry Systems or MITS, who were located in Albuquerque, New Mexico,
    saying that they were developing a basic software program that would run the
    Altair computer. In reality, they didn't have an Altair to work with. The
    company agreed to a demonstration, so the pair worked hard on writing the
    program. The program worked and Allen was hired by the company and Gates
    would soon leave Harvard to join him.
  </p>
  <p>
    Gates and Allen then established Microsoft on April 4th, 1975, with Gates as
    the CEO. The name was a blend of "microcomputer" and "software". While Gates
    oversaw the business, he would also continue to write code himself and
    review it before it shipped. IBM approached Microsoft in July 1980 as they
    wanted an operating system for its upcoming personal computer. Gates said it
    could be done, although Microsoft didn't actually have such an operating
    system for IBM's new PCs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Gates approached a small software company and made an offer of $50,000 for
    an already-made system called 86-DOS, keeping it confidential who it was
    for. He adapted it for the PC and delivered it to IBM as PC-DOS for the same
    price of $50,000. Keeping the source code, Gates required that
    manufacturers, including IBM, pay a licensing fee. Microsoft licensed the
    software to PC manufacturers as MS-DOS, making the company a major player in
    the industry, with sales going from 7 million dollars in 1980 to 16 million
    dollars in 1981.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the same time, Apple, led by Steve Jobs, invited Microsoft to write
    software for their computers. Through these collaborations, Gates identified
    that Macintosh's work-in-progress graphical user interface was much more
    user-friendly than the text and keyboard-driven MS-DOS system Microsoft
    currently had. Gates would then soon announce his own graphical user
    interface called Windows for all PCs with MS-DOS. In 1984, Apple launched
    the Macintosh and a year later Gates and Microsoft launched Windows.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 1987, Bill Gates, at age 31, had become the world's youngest billionaire.
    Gates continued to improve Windows and persuaded computer manufacturers to
    preload it on every computer sold and, by 1993, Windows was running on
    almost 85% of the world's computers. This would also cause investigations
    into Microsoft for unfair marketing practices as a monopoly.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 1995, Gates launched the revolutionary Windows 95 and expanded into the
    World Wide Web after his "Internet Tidal-Wave" memo. By 1998, Microsoft was
    the world's biggest company. Gates stepped down as CEO in 2002 to Steve
    Ballmer. Since then, Bill Gates has dedicated his life to philanthropy,
    funding disease prevention, combating poverty and improving education around
    the world.
