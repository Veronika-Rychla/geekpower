    What is the difference between programming and coding, and why is it
    actually kind of useful to know that? In this video, we're not going to go
    into official definitions. There are a few important distinctions that can
    actually be pretty useful to know, and it can keep you out of trouble with
    using the wrong word, let's say because, weirdly, people can get sort of
    offended if you call them a coder. So let's get into it, and at the end, you
    can let me know if you agree or disagree with my take on this.
  </p>
  <p>
    Okay, now let's start with programming which is a set of instructions that
    define behavior. Now, I could use real-life examples like how we're
    programmed to get hungry and tired, check social media, talk about Pavlov's
    dogs and stuff like that, but I won't. What I'll say instead is that
    programming is the manifestation of logic. Programming equals logic, and
    this is why, in fact, many consider programming the close cousin of math and
    why math majors are actually equally sought after for the top most complex
    software engineering jobs. And in colleges, you'll find a class called
    discrete math, which is often specifically math for programming.
  </p>
  <p>
    Don't let that scare you, though. You do not need a formal background in
    this stuff to become a great programmer and you can figure a lot of it out
    as you go. But these are a few reasons why people call programming applied
    math. Ultimately, in the world of logic, you can think of math as the
    theoretical branch and programming as the practical branch. This logical
    basis is why even though they look like code, you'll hear people say that
    CSS and HTML are not real programming languages. So it's not because they're
    backend elitists, at least not in most cases.
  </p>
  <p>
    Anyway, programming and not coding skills are what most of the biggest tech
    companies test for and it's why they let you take your interview a lot of
    the time in any language that you want. This is why these interviews are
    often done on a whiteboard with something called pseudocode, where you're
    just writing out steps in plain English rather than specific coding syntax.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, one final example: there's a course that focuses purely on programming
    and not coding and that's Harvard's CS50. A lot of people are surprised when
    the first week and homework are not even in a real programming language;
    it's just some kids' programming language called Scratch. Then, from there,
    the course quickly moves from language to language, from C to JavaScript to
    Python, and it's not because it's covering as many languages as possible but
    rather focusing on the logical elements and patterns instead of the specific
    code samples.
  </p>
  <p>
    Okay, now let's talk about coding, which in some ways is broader and, in
    others, more specific. We could call coding the implementation or details of
    a logical programming solution, but as we know, that's not necessarily the
    case because we can also code in something like HTML or CSS. For this
    reason, it's harder to pin down a specific definition of coding, but one
    thing's for sure: to be a good coder, you have to learn the syntax of
    different coding languages.
  </p>
  <p>
    In many ways, the logical problem-solving of programming is on a higher
    level of abstraction than coding, which is more focused on technical
    details. Details like code quality, breaking things into functions and
    different files and leveraging code libraries all come into play here. Now,
    interestingly, you can swap out different code solutions for the exact same
    programming outcome. This is part of the reason the first code we write in
    any new language is "Hello World," which is completely the same in
    programming terms but different in every language in coding terms.
  </p>
  <p>
    Javascript "console log," Python "print," and the Java one that is super
    long, just like everything in Java. One important thing to keep in mind is
    if you try to explain coding details to non-developers, they will quickly
    fall asleep. This is where some of the age-old conflicts between technical
    and non-technical people on a team emerge, where the developers are pushing
    to refactor the code base, the project manager is asking what's the benefit
    to the end user, and met with blank stairs.
  </p>
  <p>
    To give a course example for coding: if you see anything like Basic
    JavaScript, Python 101, Advanced Python, these are very focused on pure
    coding concepts. In other words, the syntax and patterns of a specific
    language. Also, be a bit careful: calling someone a coder is a bit
    slanderous in the developer world. It kind of implies that you're just a cog
    or a machine and all you're good for is writing code and also that you're
    easily replaceable by another coder and that person could also be on the
    other side of the world.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, with both these definitions, it's fair to say that once you know
    programming, coding is really easy. It's why experienced developers can
    learn new languages so fast. Learning programming also helps you build
    mental models and I think it's no coincidence that the world is now run by
    former programmers: Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and
    for this one, let's just leave their reputations out of it.
  </p>
  <p>
    So you will hear a lot of people say: focus on programming when you're
    starting out. Don't worry about coding language, and people think this gives
    them permission to go learn five different languages just because they're
    not focused on language. But the truth is, the faster you can master a
    single language, the sooner you can get beyond just the coding step, and you
    can only focus on the programming because you're not constantly learning a
    new syntax.
  </p>
  <p>
    Anyway, just a bonus here at the end. Let's compare both of these to
    development. Development is more focused on the solution outcome or business
    need, and development solutions can involve much, much more than programming
    or coding. Now, while we do see coding jobs automated more and more by
    better tooling, code generators and even machine learning algorithms, the
    principles of programming are here to stay and we could see the number of
    jobs requiring pure coding drop. Even if you move beyond the job of being a
    programmer and want to become the next Elon Musk, he can still help you a
    lot.
