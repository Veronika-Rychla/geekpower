  <span class="brand__power">Grammar</span> - Wishful thinking
</h2>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  Jak už bylo řečeno v předchozí lekci, reálné podmínky (Zero Conditional a
  First Conditional) se používají k vyjádření skutečných možností v budoucnosti.
  Jde o situace, které se opravdu mohou stát v současnosti nebo v budoucnu, a
  jsou považovány za pravděpodobné nebo možné.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 If it rains tomorrow, we will cancel the picnic. = opravdu tento scénář
  může nastat, jde tedy o podmínku zcela reálnou
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 If you click 'archive,' the document disappeaers, but it's not deleted. =
  takto se aplikace chová, kdykoli uživatel klikne na tlačítko Uložit
</p>

<p class="lesson_paragraph marginer">
  Second a Third Conditional jsou však takzvané
  <span class="example-underlined">nereálné podmínky</span>. Vyjadřují situace
  <span class="example-underlined"
    >hypotetické nebo takové, které jsou nepravděpodobné či zcela
    imaginární</span
  >. Pojďme se nyní podívat na Second Conditional.
</p>

<p class="lesson_paragraph expanded">💡 Wishful thinking 💡</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  "Wishful thinking" je termín používaný k popisu situace, kdy si člověk přeje
  nebo doufá, že se něco stane, i když je to nepravděpodobné nebo nereálné. Jde
  o druh myšlení, který je více založen na přáních a nadějích než na logice nebo
  skutečnosti. Wishful thinking často ignoruje realitu ve prospěch
  optimistického nebo idealizovaného výsledku.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 Thinking that buying a lottery ticket will ensure retirement is pure
  wishful thinking.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 Hoping that simply wanting a new job will result in job offers without
  applying is a classic example of wishful thinking.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 Believing that a complex software bug will fix itself overnight is wishful
  thinking.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph example">
  🧩 Believing the team can finish the project in one week, despite needing two
  weeks for similar projects in the past, is wishful thinking.

<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  Second Conditional se používá k vyjádření hypotetických nebo nepravděpodobných
  situacích a jejich možných výsledcích. Je zvláště užitečný pro představování
  scénářů v současnosti nebo budoucnosti, které nejsou reálné, ale jsou zajímavé
  na přemýšlení nebo diskusi.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  Část věty s 'if' používá prostý minulý čas. Přestože se používá minulý čas,
  význam není o minulosti; jedná se o hypotetickou nebo nereálnou situaci v
  současnosti nebo budoucnosti. Hlavní část věty (výsledek 'if') používá 'would'
  následované základním tvarem slovesa.

  <p>
    Let's talk about conditional statements. Conditional statements let us
    perform actions based on if a condition is met. We use them to help direct
    the behavior of our programs. In fact, we actually use conditional
    statements in our everyday lives. Have you ever gone to a cafe but didn't
    really know what you wanted to order? You've probably narrowed down what you
    want, kind of like this: "Do I want something refreshing or something else?
    If I want something refreshing, I guess I could get something like an iced
    coffee or an iced tea. I guess I'll get some tea, but what flavor do I want?
    Oh god, there's so many flavors to choose from. Am I feeling a little
    adventurous, or should I pick something safe? Something tart, maybe
    something citrusy, maybe strawberry. But can I even afford this? What am I
    doing with my life? Do my parents even love me? Did I leave the oven on?"
  </p>
  <p>
    Well, to help our indecisive mind figure out what we want, we can use
    something called a flowchart. Flowcharts help us plan and visualize the
    different outcomes in our program. Looking back at our cafe scenario, we can
    use a flowchart to figure out what we want to get. First, we ask ourselves,
    "Do we want something refreshing?" If not, "Do we want something hot?" If we
    do, then we'll get a smoothie, but if not, we'll just not get anything at
    all and go home. But if we choose to get a refreshing drink, then we ask
    ourselves, "Do you want tea?" If not, then we'll get an iced coffee. But if
    I do want tea, then do I want raspberry? If we do, then great, we'll get
    raspberry, but if not, we'll just get some kiwi-flavored tea instead.
  </p>
  <p>
    In programming, you can represent these decisions with what's known as an if
    statement. An if statement is a conditional statement where if the condition
    is met, then an action happens. So, if I'm in the mood for something
    refreshing, then I'll order a fruity drink. Now that we have an idea of what
    an if statement is, let's see how we go about writing one.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a disclaimer, even though writing an if statement is pretty much the same
    in most modern languages, it's important to check your specific language to
    make sure you didn't miss anything. In this case, we're using the language
    Java, but this would also work for the languages C, C++, C#, and JavaScript.
  </p>
  <p>
    Anyways, back to the video. We start an if statement by simply putting the
    word "if" at the beginning of two parentheses. Then you would follow up with
    a condition. A condition is something that we check to see if it's true, and
    if it is, the computer will execute whatever's inside our little curly
    brackets. Like, is three greater than two? It is, so it'll execute the code,
    and if it's not true, then the computer will just continue reading through
    your code and ignore whatever you wrote here between the brackets. Voila!
    What are some ways we can check our condition?
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm glad you asked, Kevin. The way we check to see if our condition is true
    is by using comparison operators. These comparison operators are exactly
    what you'd see in your elementary class. Get out and shut up, we got the
    less than, the greater than, and well, you know the rest. And in
    programming, we write these symbols a little differently. Notice how "equals
    to" has two equal signs. This is because only using one equal sign means
    you're assigning values to a variable. So here, we're saying A is equal to
    3, and B is equal to 3. But when you use two equal signs, you're checking to
    see if the left side is equal to the right side. And if you want to check
    that something is not equal to something else, an exclamation point is a
    universal way in programming to represent the word "not." So, putting an
    exclamation point in front of an equal sign means "not equal to."
    Technically, the exclamation point itself is kind of another operator, but
    we'll get to that in a moment.
  </p>
  <p>
    So now that we know how if statements and conditions work, we can look at an
    example. So let's say a drink costs $4.95, I currently have $5.75, and I
    currently don't have a drink. But going into our conditional, since the
    money I do have is more than $4.95, now I can have a drink. But let's say
    you want to check for two conditions in the same if statement, like "Do I
    have enough money, and do they have the flavor I want?" In that case, you
    can combine conditions with what's known as a logical operator.
  </p>
  <p>
    Logical operators are simply the words "and," "or," and "not." The nice
    thing is they work exactly how you would expect them to in plain English.
    So, if I want to check if two conditions are both true, we would use the
    word "and," which is represented by two ampersands, you know, those little
    squiggly boys. So, looking at this example, I want to check if I have more
    than $4.95 and that my favorite flavor is in stock. Since they are both
    true, the computer will run the code inside the if statement. But let's say
    we only have $3.50. $3.50 is less than $4.95, which makes this condition
    false. Even though they have the drink we want, "and" requires both
    conditions to be true to run the code. So, since we have one condition that
    failed, the computer will ignore what's inside of our if statement and
    continue on with our program.
  </p>
  <p>
    If we want to check to see if at least one of the conditions is true, we
    would use the "or" operator, which is represented by two straight lines. So,
    if I have more than $4.95, or the cafe has the flavor I want in stock, I'll
    buy a drink. So, only one condition needs to be true to execute the code,
    and if both fail, then the computer ignores the stuff inside and continues
    on with your program. And lastly, we can check if our condition is not true
    by using the "not" operator. As we mentioned earlier, the exclamation point
    is the universal way of representing the word "not." So, if we put the
    exclamation point in front of the condition, we can check that if our
    condition is not true.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, we know that if statements check if our conditions are true. Without the
    exclamation point, our if statement would check to see if our money is
    greater than or equal to $4.95, then do whatever's inside the curly braces.
    But let's say I only have 75 cents, and I want something to happen if I
    don't have enough money. If we put an exclamation point, now the if
    statement can check to see if our condition is not true and then proceed to
    the code inside the curly braces. So, in this case, if we don't have enough
    money, then our mood is set to sad.
  </p>
  <p>
    Anyway, that's it when it comes to if statements by themselves. To recap, if
    statements just check to see if something is true, then, if it is, it'll
    execute some code. What, uh, what if you want something to happen if your if
    statement fails? Well, I'm glad you asked, Kevin. You would handle this with
    what's called an else statement. You attach this to the end of your if
    statement as a default action if your condition doesn't pass. Take a look.
    So, if we have more than $4.95, then our mood is happy, else we'll be sad.
    But let's say you have a few different decisions to make, like, for example,
    Kevin here wants something fruity if it's available, but if it's not, then
    he'll get a smoothie, and if they're out of that too, he'll just get a
    water. Well, if we write this with three different if statements, look what
    happens. Fruity is available, so great, we can get that. But now our code
    continues, and now we've also bought a smoothie, and we've also gotten a
    water since they're all available. Now we've got all these drinks that we
    didn't want.
  </p>
  <p>
    To avoid this, we can combine if and else statements to make something
    called an else if statement. That way, if our first condition is met, in
    this case, we get something fruity, our code will stop there, and we won't
    have to buy everything else. But if our condition doesn't succeed, then
    it'll continue down the rest of the else if statements until one of them
    passes.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, that's if statements in a nutshell. Now, let's put all this information
    together with a couple of examples. So, this is Blub Junior. As Blubs get
    older, they get bigger, so we can give them size categories based on their
    age here. Blub Junior's age is three. So, looking at our first if statement,
    we see that if his age is less than or equal to 3, he'll be classified as a
    small Blub, and the program will skip the other two conditions.
  </p>
  <p>
    But let's say he gets older, and his age is now set to 12. Since 12 is
    greater than 3, our first condition will fail, and our program will move on
    to the second condition. Now, since Blub's age is between 3 and 15, our
    condition here will pass, and now Blub is classified as a medium Blub. And
    finally, let's say Blub is all grown up at the age of 21. Since 21 is
    greater than 3, our program will skip the first condition and move on to
    condition 2. Looking at our condition here, we see that even though 21 is
    greater than 3, it's not less than 15. And since our AND operator requires
    both conditions to be true, this condition will fail as well. Since neither
    of these conditions passed, we're left with our else statement, which will
    let us take care of any other age that isn't handled by the other two
    conditions, making this Blub a big boy.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, here's a more complex example with an if statement inside of an if
    statement. We want to identify our mysterious Blub. We first check if our
    color is white. It is, so we go inside our curly braces. But now, we see
    there's another if statement nested inside our other one. Nested if
    statements help us get more specific with checking our data. In this case,
    we can get more specific information about our mysterious Blub. If they're a
    white female Blub, then this Blub is identified as Blephet. If both are not,
    then it's identified as Mr. Blub. And if our mysterious Blub isn't even
    white, then they're probably Kevin.
