  <p>
    Being a software engineer sucks. I was told I would be working in a
    fast-paced, exciting environment, but in reality, I'm stuck in this cubicle
    building super complex stuff that nobody understands or appreciates. If I
    had a time machine, I would do two things: one, I would tell Harambe to get
    away from that kid, and two, I would go back to school to become a civil
    engineer so I could work outside building stuff everyone admires, like
    bridges and skyscrapers. Unfortunately, I haven't figured out how to build a
    time machine in JavaScript yet.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, I would never recommend anybody choose software engineering as a
    career, but if you do make bad life choices like me, you should be prepared
    for some really bad things to happen. Like every doctor eventually loses a
    patient, and every pilot eventually crashes a plane, likewise, every
    software engineer will eventually face a merge conflict and that's not even
    very bad.
  </p>
  <p>
    In today's video, we'll look at seven different devastating text messages
    that no developer ever wants to hear. Speaking of which, I finally started a
    Discord, so feel free to chat with me over there after this video. We've got
    some T-shirts and licenses to JetBrain software to give away over there.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of the biggest problems with software engineering is that you don't want
    your friends and family to find out what you do. The reason is you'll get
    messages like this from your uncle or old roommate asking if you want to
    build an app together. It will consist of a very dumb idea that's impossibly
    complex to execute, like Uber but for horses or TikTok without the Chinese,
    with a $500 budget.
  </p>
  <p>
    Messages like this are so painful because software engineers are usually
    introverts who have a hard time saying "no."" What you'll want to do is
    respond and say, "Hey, that's an awesome idea! I would love to build it for
    you, but my rate is $300 an hour." What they'll likely do is come back with
    a counteroffer of zero dollars per hour but 10% equity in the company, which
    will eventually be worth billions. That's pretty much checkmate. "Trust
    speaks for itself."" I would just recommend accepting the offer and building
    the app to get them to go away.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, when you're not building apps for friends and family, you should be
    working on your own side projects, and in doing that, you'll likely use the
    cloud like AWS. One of the worst messages you can receive is a cloud billing
    alert like: "Hey, it's AWS. Your $25 budget has been exceeded by $2.3
    million dollars." Maybe you clicked the wrong button or accidentally created
    an infinite loop, but the important thing here is not to panic.
  </p>
  <p>
    The easiest solution is to just stop using AWS and pretend nothing ever
    happened. If Jeff ever sends his guys after you, just tell them your account
    got hacked. That may or may not work, and if it doesn't, you can at least
    find comfort in knowing there are many other homeless people out there who
    simply forgot to turn off an EC2 instance.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another dreaded, catastrophic thing a developer doesn't want to hear is that
    a production database has been dropped accidentally along with all of your
    company's data that was worth billions of dollars. You just made the simple
    mistake of dropping "prod" instead of "dev." When something like this
    happens, it's absolutely terrifying, but hopefully, you have backups that
    are able to restore it back to its original state. If not, now would be a
    good time to start looking for a new job. Dropping a database is incredibly
    easy and can be accomplished with a single line of code. You can use this
    knowledge to fight back against the system, as this person did here by
    weaponizing SQL injection against speed cameras.
  </p>
  <p>
    Dropping a database is bad, but at least it's over quickly. Many developers
    suffer a worse fate, like this guy who got a message from his boss assigning
    him to a legacy AngularJS version 1 code base that needs to be migrated to
    Angular 14. Sadly, the previous developer died of old age and was the only
    one who had any idea how anything in this codebase worked.
  </p>
  <p>
    He knew exactly how to keep his job by creating an overly complex codebase
    without any comments or documentation and now it's your turn to update it.
    "F*** my life!" This job will take more skill and ingenuity than building a
    nuclear submarine, and when you finally finish the job in a few years, no
    one will even notice or care because, by that time, it'll be time to migrate
    your legacy code base into the hot new JavaScript framework of 2025.
  </p>
  <p>
    Speaking of which, something a web developer never wants to hear is that a
    new, better JavaScript framework has been invented. When you learn a
    JavaScript framework, you join a tribe and that means everything outside
    that tribe is dangerous and terrible. Now, normally, you can create an echo
    chamber to convince yourself that your chosen framework is absolutely 100%
    the best in every use case. However, at some point, you may be convinced
    that a better framework does, in fact, exist. When that day comes, you'll
    need to turn your back on your tribe and lose many friends in the process,
    and it's not exactly easy to make new friends when you're a software
    engineer.
  </p>
  <p>
    But one of the most annoying things that can happen to you is when a
    non-technical person, like a client or marketing expert, asks you to make
    one small change to an already finished product, like: "Let's just move this
    nav bar from the top over to the side here. It should be an easy change for
    you to make." You don't want not to look like a 10X developer, so you go
    ahead and do it, but it takes like 20 hours and modifications in 800
    different HTML and CSS files. Then, as soon as you commit your work, that
    same person will come back and say: "You know what? I think I liked it
    better the first way. Let's go ahead and change it back."
  </p>
  <p>
    It's no secret that the most important skill of a software engineer is being
    able to Google things effectively. That means one of the worst things that
    can happen to you is running into a problem that nobody else has already
    solved for you. It's painful enough when zero results come back on Google
    with your error message, but an even worse thing can happen.
  </p>
  <p>
    You might search an error and get a single result on an obscure forum from
    10 years ago and find some dude going through the exact same problem as you.
    As you scroll down, hoping for a well-documented and detailed solution, you
    find that all he posted was: "Fixed. All good now." And now you have to
    figure out the problem all by yourself. Being the Chad that you are, you get
    to work, and as soon as you're about to solve the problem, you get a
    notification that it's time for your daily stand-up meeting.
