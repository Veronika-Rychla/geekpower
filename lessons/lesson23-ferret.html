  Mixed conditionals (smíšené podmínky) jsou věty, které kombinují dva různé
  typy podmínkových vět. Používají se k vyjádření složitých podmínek a výsledků,
  zejména když se podmínka a výsledek týkají různých časů. To může být zvláště
  užitečné v kontextech IT a programování, kde hypotetické nebo skutečné scénáře
  často zahrnují kombinaci minulých akcí a současných nebo budoucích důsledků.

  V IT se často setkáváme s komplexními situacemi, kde je důležité chápat vztah
  mezi minulými akcemi a jejich současnými nebo budoucími důsledky. Smíšené
  podmínkové věty umožňují vyjádřit tyto situace přesněji. Při analýze IT
  problémů nebo při hledání řešení je důležité umět popsat, co se stalo v
  minulosti, a jak to ovlivňuje současné situace. Při prezentování projektů,
  reportování výsledků nebo diskusích o potenciálních řešeních je důležité být
  schopný jasně a přesně vyjádřit složité myšlenky. Smíšené podmínkové věty jsou
  pro to ideální.

    These people are panicking because they’re being asked to step out of an
    elevator onto a single plank that’s suspended 80 stories in the air. Oh,
    man. This game is called Richie’s Plank Experience and by their very real
    reactions, you might expect some groundbreaking, photorealistic visuals
    behind that headset.
  </p>
  <p>
    But that’s really not the case. Sure, it’s nice, but it’s clearly not real.
    The graphics are really beautiful, but the lighting isn’t quite right;
    things are just a little too diffused. The buildings are almost too smooth.
    The plants on the ground are clearly squared off. It’s hard to believe these
    people aren’t dramatizing their reactions for the camera.
  </p>
  <p>
    But it’s not just the plank experience. The internet is full of VR fails,
    where people are sucked into pixelated worlds with disembodied parts in
    front of them. But this really got me thinking. How is it that a virtual
    world that doesn’t look very real at all, feel so real?
  </p>
  <p>
    Of course, the first major difference between watching VR and being in it is
    putting on the headset. Here's where VR marketing has mostly failed. Right?
    Because it's always shown from a spectator's perspective. And as a
    spectator, you do not get the experience of the person in VR. Thong Nguyen
    is the founder and CEO of Roomera, a company that helps businesses test and
    understand new spaces before they're built using virtual reality.
  </p>
  <p>
    VR communicates to your brain in a different way than looking at a screen.
    When looking at a screen — like our TV or phone — our brains read this as a
    flat image, in the same way we would view a picture. If an object on a
    screen gets bigger or smaller, or a person on TV moves toward the camera,
    you don’t feel the need to take a step back or move out of their way, but in
    VR you might want to, because you’re not looking at one screen. You’re
    looking at two. And those two screens are literally right in front of your
    eyes, projecting a slightly different image into each eye.
  </p>
  <p>
    Which is how our vision works in the real world — each eye takes in stimuli
    from a slightly different vantage point. You can test this: Hold your finger
    up in front of your face and wink each of your eyes. Your finger should
    “jump” back and forth. That “jump” is the difference between what your left
    and right eye are seeing. The differences between what your eyes see conveys
    depth. It conveys three dimensions. This is known as stereopsis, and VR
    developers have spent a lot of time perfecting it.
  </p>
  <p>
    But what use is depth if you can’t move through it? Which brings us to the
    next most important way virtual reality tricks your brain: you are the
    camera, and it's fast enough where your brain starts interpreting it as your
    perspective. Head tracking allows a person in VR to look and move around a
    fake world in the same way we look and move around a real one. If you look
    left, you’ll see more of the world to your left. And if you look down… Okay,
    maybe don't look down.
  </p>
  <p>
    Other subtle effects make virtual spaces feel more real: Like 360 audio,
    which is a big part of the plank experience. As you turn your head, the wind
    will subtly change. The plank creaks, and if you listen closely, a heart
    beat slowly begins to speed up. Our brain takes all this new, virtual
    stimuli and begins to believe that this is reality. Our brain has never
    really learned within the last one hundred fifty thousand years to actually
    distinguish between computer generated content and the real world.
  </p>
  <p>
    Dr. Frank Steinicke has been studying immersive technologies like VR for
    nearly 20 years. If all the cues that we perceive from the virtual
    environment are so similar to the cues that we get in the real world, it
    makes sense that we are unable to clearly distinguish between both. Our
    brains quickly adapt to virtual environments largely because it’s wired to
    trust our sense of sight. There's some research showing that approximately
    80 percent of all the information that we perceive from our environment are
    based on vision only.
  </p>
  <p>
    And this allows VR developers to manipulate our reality even further: what
    we found out about 10 years ago is that if we guide users on a circular arc
    with a radius of 20 meters, they have no chance to identify that. They
    actually walk in a circle in the real world when they see a straight path in
    the virtual environment. You can walk an entire virtual city without ever
    leaving a room.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once we believe the environment is real and accept that we’re actually in
    it, our brains then go on to fill in some other blanks: there is interesting
    findings that if you are in the virtual world in a very, let's say, snow or
    icy environment, people feel cool, although they're in the real world and
    maybe in a hot environment.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of games, VR has shown a lot of promise in the medical world from
    reducing pain for burn victims by immersing them in a snowy world while
    their bandages are changed and with exposure therapy that helps people with
    phobias — like a fear of heights — and body dysmorphia. It’s also been used
    for physical therapy like assisting elderly people with their balance.
  </p>
  <p>
    Right now, we’re still tethered to a system with a headset on our faces. The
    graphics are nice, but not perfect — and so we’re not fully immersed when we
    hover 80 stories above the ground. That is...we can still remember to take
    the headset off. Steinicke cautions that it might not always be that way. We
    can easily assume that within the next five to 10 years or so, we will not
    be able to distinguish visually computer generated content from real world
    content anymore. And then, of course, there are a lot of ethical questions.
  </p>
  <p>
    For now, VR might not look exactly like reality, but it follows a lot of the
    rules our brain has learned to perceive as real, and that’s often enough to
    make us sweat.
