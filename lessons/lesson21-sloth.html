  <span class="brand__power">Grammar</span> - Ještě hlouběji do minulosti
</h2>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  Ještě než se pustíme do třetího typu podmínky, musíme se na chvíli zastavit a
  strojem času se dostat ještě hlouběji do minulosti, než sahají past simple a
  past continuous. Cože?! Ano, slyšíte dobře, angličtina umí vyjádřit i
  takzvanou předminulost.
</p>
<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  Předminulý čas (past perfect) se používá k vyjádření dějů, které byly
  dokončeny ještě před nějakým jiným dějem v minulosti. Představte si, že
  potřebujete vyjádřit situaci, kdy jste například dokončili nějaký kus kódu na
  projektu a následně zjistili, že váš kolega tutéž část již udělal dříve, ale
  zapomněl ji pushnout na GitHub. Protože vyprávíte o svém programování v
  minulosti (I finished the task), ale kolega udělal svou činnost ještě před
  vámi, tedy hlouběji v minulosti, potřebujete právě předminulý čas (He had
  coded that part).

  Dobré pochopení a správné použití past perfect může vaši komunikaci v IT
  prostředí zlepšit několika hned několika způsoby:
  <span class="example-underlined">Přesnější popis událostí:</span> Ve světě IT
  je důležité přesně popisovat, kdy a v jakém pořadí došlo k určitým událostem,
  například při diagnostikování problémů nebo vysvětlování postupů. Minulý
  předčasný čas umožňuje zdůraznit, že jedna akce byla dokončena dříve než jiná
  minulá akce.
</p>

<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  <span class="example-underlined">Efektivnější komunikace v týmu:</span> V
  multikulturních a různorodých týmech, kde nemusí být angličtina prvním jazykem
  všech členů, může přesné použití gramatických past perfect zlepšit vzájemné
  porozumění a zabránit nedorozuměním ohledně načasování a posloupnosti
  událostí.
  <span class="example-underlined">Lepší analýza a řešení problémů:</span> Při
  analýze problémů nebo incidentů v IT je důležité určit, které události se
  udály a v jakém pořadí. Past perfect pomáhá zřetelně odlišit akce, které se
  staly před jinými minulými událostmi, což je klíčové pro pochopení příčin a
  následků.

    When you think of a laptop, you most likely have something like this in
    mind, but find out that the first laptops weighed dozens of kilograms and
    were not really portable. Let's find the history of laptops and how they
    have evolved over time.
  </p>
  <p>
    The foundations of the evolution of portable computers were laid in 1975,
    when IBM launched the first portable computer, the IBM 5100. You couldn't
    hold it in your lap, because it was very heavy, weighing 25kg. However, it
    was portable and came with a 5-inch screen, a 1.9 MHz processor, and used a
    magnetic tape cartridge for data storage.
  </p>
  <p>
    But in 1981 Osborne 1 was launched, considered by many to be the first truly
    portable laptop. It weighed 11 kg and could be closed and transported like a
    suitcase. The Osborne 1 had a 5-inch screen and was the first computer to
    have 2 built-in floppy disk drives, and was powered by a 4MHz processor and
    64KB of RAM. The Osborne 1 was a real success, both from the point of view
    of portability and the rather low price, only 6,000 USD, in today's price.
  </p>
  <p>
    Immediately, the Grid Compass was launched, which by its design set a
    standard for modern laptops. The Grid Compass 1101 was the first clamshell
    laptop, and due to its small size, it was used by NASA in their space
    shuttle program at the time. The laptop was equipped with an Intel 8086
    processor and had a 320 x 240 pixel display, all in a package that weighed
    5kg.
  </p>
  <p>
    Epson launched in 1982, the first portable computer with a built-in printer,
    which was small enough to fit in a briefcase. The Epson HX-20 featured a
    68-key keyboard, rechargeable batteries, a very small LCD screen (120×32
    pixels) and 16 KB of RAM, all for the price of just $759, about $2,300
    today.
  </p>
  <p>
    Built in 1985, the first device with a modern form factor for a laptop was
    launched. The aluminum Kaypro 2000 came with a removable keyboard, LCD
    screen and lead-acid battery. All for $1995, about $5,600 today. In 1986,
    IMB launched the Convertible PC, with a rather intriguing design and shape.
    It had a removable 640 x 200 LCD screen, a 3.5 inch floppy drive and weighed
    6kg. The laptop cost about $5,600 in today's money, but it was not at all a
    success, as a new laptop came on the market that promised to "offer twice
    the computing power of the IBM laptop for less money." This is the Toshiba
    T1100. It had more RAM, a 640 x 200 pixel monochrome LCD display and was
    powered by the 7.16 MHz Intel 80C86 processor.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 1987, Hewlett-Packard distinguished itself with the Vectra Portable CS,
    the first laptop with a 3-inch floppy drive capable of using 1.44 MB floppy
    disks. However, this was not enough, and the Vectra Portable was not
    successful, both because of its large size and its high price.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 1989, Apple entered the laptop market with the Macintosh Portable,
    Apple's first battery-powered computer. It had a 9.8-inch black-and-white
    screen, a 40 MB hard drive, trackball and weighed 7.2 kg. Moreover, this is
    considered the worst Apple product ever made, if the computer's battery
    failed, it could no longer work, and the small storage space and off-white
    color and high price led to the failure of the Macintosh Portable. Apple
    learned from its mistakes, and introduced the PowerBook series in 1991,
    which initiated the form factor standards for laptops. Clasp closure, screen
    over the keyboard, larger screens, support for hands and trackpad.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following year, IBM launched the ThinkPad 700C, considered an important
    stone in the evolution of laptops, being the best-known, best-selling and
    most appreciated IBM laptop. The ThinkPad came with a 10.4-inch color LCD
    display, was powered by the Intel 486SLC 25 MHz processor, had 4 MB of RAM,
    and had an 80 or 120 MB hard drive. The laptop weighed only 2.6 kg and was
    sold starting at 2375 USD, which is 5000 USD today.
  </p>
  <p>
    Apple's PowerBook series initially featured optional color displays on the
    PowerBook 165c model, and with the 1994 500 series, Apple introduced the
    first true touchpad, the first 16-bit stereo audio, and the first built-in
    Ethernet network adapter. The price for such a model was about $2,270, which
    is $4,600 today.
  </p>
  <p>
    Also in 1944, IMB introduced the first laptop with an integrated CD-ROM
    drive, the ThinkPad 775CD model. Now that the form factor for a laptop has
    been established, the big manufacturers are trying to innovate on the design
    and size side. Apple stood out with the iBook series in 1999, which came
    with an unusual design inspired by the iMac design of the time. However, the
    iBook stood out by introducing Wi-fi connectivity, being the first with such
    a feature.
  </p>
  <p>
    Faster than we expected, in 2002 the first gaming laptop was launched, the
    Alienware Area-51M model. It wasn't cheap at all, but for $3000, the laptop
    offered top specs at the time. A 3.06GHz Pentium 4 processor, 1GB of 266MHz
    memory, 40GB of storage and a 2048 x 1536 UXGA screen. Also in the 2000s,
    Dell was the leader in the laptop market, being very popular and cool for a
    long time. It was also then that Toshiba launched the world's thinnest
    laptop, the Toshiba Portege 2000. It had a front edge of only 1.49 cm high,
    extending slightly to 1.91 cm at the back.
  </p>
  <p>
    During this whole period, we tried to make the laptops as small, thin and
    performant at the same time. But the one that stood out was Apple with the
    MacBook Air from 2008. This was the thinnest laptop in the world measuring
    just 0.4cm at its thinnest point and 1.9cm at its thickest point. At the
    same time, it was the first laptop without an integrated optical drive. In
    2012, Microsoft launched the Microsoft Surface, being the first to
    successfully combine tablet and laptop. However, this type of devices were
    not very successful, many considering that the two devices should remain
    separate.
  </p>
  <p>
    If at the beginning of the 80s there was only the idea of a portable
    computer, so that later we had what we now call "laptops", today we have a
    choice of many categories of laptops, depending on everyone's needs and
    budget, whether you want a laptop thin, with high autonomy, thin frames,
    powerful or convertible hardware.
