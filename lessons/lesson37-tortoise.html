    Bash is a command language interpreter for interacting with a computer from
    the command line. It's also called a shell because it surrounds the
    operating system kernel to hide its intricate details while allowing you,
    the programmer, to do important stuff like access data and write files by
    typing simple commands. This was a revolutionary concept when it was
    developed in the early 70s, back when programmers were still using punch
    cards. The shell concept evolved over the years, with the Bourne Shell being
    the most popular version. That is until 1989 when the Bourne-Again Shell, or
    Bash, came about.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you open up the terminal on a Unix machine like macOS and most Linux
    distros, the default shell is usually Bash. It provides a prompt where you
    can type a command, which will then be interpreted by the shell and executed
    on the operating system. To find out if you're running Bash, type in "which
    $SHELL" from the command line. It's like any other application that lives in
    the binaries directory, but Bash is also a programming language which allows
    us to write scripts, which means anything we type manually into the command
    line can be automated with code.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you first launch the shell, it actually runs a startup script that's
    defined in the Bash profile or bashrc file on your system. This allows you
    to customize the behavior and appearance of the shell whenever you start a
    new session. You can add your own custom Bash scripts to any project by
    creating a file that ends in .sh, or no file extension at all. The first
    line in that file should always be a #! shebang, followed by the path to the
    application that should run it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Below that, we can start writing commands, like "echo," to print something,
    and they'll be interpreted line by line. To create a variable, type a name
    in all caps, followed by the equal sign, then reference it later in the
    script using a dollar sign in front of the name. Now, to execute the script,
    simply type the file name into the shell.
  </p>
  <p>
    That was easy, but what if we want to pass in some arguments when we run the
    script? Positional arguments will automatically be assigned variable names
    of $1, $2, $3, and so on. Now, in other cases, you may need additional user
    input in the middle of a script. You can create loops in Bash, like a
    do-while loop here, that will prompt the user to continue the script on a
    'yes' answer or exit on a 'no' answer.
  </p>
  <p>
    From there, we can implement conditional logic with an if statement, which
    will test if the value on the left side is less than the value on the right
    side. If true, then run this command; otherwise, run the else command.
    Another cool feature is that if you have multiple long-running processes,
    you can run them in parallel in the background by adding an ampersand after
    the command.
