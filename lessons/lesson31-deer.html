  <span class="brand__power">Grammar</span> - Počitatelnost a nepočitatelnost

<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  Teď si to trochu ztížíme a zvýšíme level. 😎 I když je k pochopení
  počitatelnosti a nepočitelnosti na začátku užitečné mít před sebou jasná
  pravidla a výčty nepočitatelných podstatných jmen k tomu mohou pomoci, ve
  skutečnosti u některých podstatných jmen (a není jich málo) koncept
  počitatelnosti a nepočitatelnosti záleží na kontextu, ve kterém je dané slovo
  použito.

<p class="lesson_paragraph">
  Victoria isn't a native English speaker. The aim of this listening exercise is
  get used to different accents. Don't forget that most of your colleagues won't
  come from Britain or the USA.
</p>
<div class="reading__text">
  <p>
    Hello, my name is Victoria, and today we are going to talk about what is
    JavaScript. Let's go. So, what is JavaScript? It is one of the most popular,
    lightweight programming languages or, in other words, a scripting language
    that web developers use when developing web pages, applications, servers, or
    games. It allows you to implement dynamic features on web pages that cannot
    be done only with HTML and CSS. Many browsers use JavaScript as a scripting
    language for doing interactive things on the web.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every time you see animated graphics, elements, colors, slideshows, or any
    other dynamic features on a website, you are seeing the effects of
    JavaScript. It improves the user experience by converting a website from a
    static page into an interactive one. When most people begin learning to
    code, they usually start with HTML and CSS, then usually move on to
    JavaScript because these three parts work together to form the foundation of
    web development. The core of your page is HTML, which contains all of the
    headers, text and any images you wish to include. CSS controls how the page
    looks, such as modifying fonts and background colors, and JavaScript is what
    makes your website come to life.
  </p>
  <p>
    Many of you may have heard of Java and wondered if it was the same as
    JavaScript. Actually, no. They're often mixed, and the only thing they have
    in common is the name Java. Java is typically used for all server-side
    development. It creates applications that run in a virtual machine or
    browser, while JavaScript is reserved for developing client-side scripts for
    functions like interactivity and is run on the browser only. While
    JavaScript mainly serves web-based programs, its programming features have
    other uses in many fields.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, in web and mobile apps, you can use JavaScript frameworks to
    create online and mobile apps. JavaScript frameworks are collections of
    JavaScript code libraries that give developers pre-written code to use for
    programming functions and tasks. The most popular JavaScript front-end
    frameworks are React, React Native, Angular and Vue. For example, front-end
    JavaScript frameworks such as jQuery and React improve design efficiency.
    They let developers reuse and modify code components without affecting their
    functionality or value.
  </p>
  <p>
    Aside from websites and apps, developers can use JavaScript to create simple
    web servers and back-end infrastructure using Node.js, saving you time and
    effort in web server building. The built-in HTTP model allows you to create
    a simple HTTP or server that displays plain text. To handle HTTP requests,
    you can use Node.js on a web server, Node OS, or a third-party one such as
    Microsoft Internet Information Services and Apache.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can also use JavaScript to create browser games. Creating games is a
    great way to start practicing your JavaScript skills. JavaScript can also be
    used to create 2D and 3D video games that run in web browsers. As the
    browsers get more powerful, web-based video games evolve beyond simple
    platforms. JavaScript frameworks like Phaser.js allow you to quickly and
    easily develop more advanced games directly from your browser. When used
    with HTML5, an application programming interface such as WebGL, JavaScript
    may help in the creation of the game.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are several JavaScript-based game engines available, including Phaser,
    GDevelop and KiwiJS which may be used to create graphics, recycle code, and
    create cross-platform programs. Some most popular games made with JavaScript
    game engines are Angry Birds, The Wizard and 2048. And here we are. Now you
    have a better understanding of what JavaScript is.
